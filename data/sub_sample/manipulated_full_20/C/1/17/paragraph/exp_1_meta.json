                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W.

BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W.

BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W.

BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W.

BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."

                "-THE CANTERVILLE GHOST-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\nWhen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\n\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\n\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, \"and if you\ndon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\nI warned you.\"\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\n\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\n\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\n\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\nrepublicans of the family.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\n\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\n\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don't at all care for blood-stains in\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\n\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\n\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton's Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\nUmney fainted.\n\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\n\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?\"\n\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won't\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\n\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\nany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don't\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\n\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\no'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\nout of \u00a350,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\nKing's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\nBabe,\" his d\u00e9but as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\n\nand the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III\n\n\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\n\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\nthe bedrooms.\"\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\nemerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\nof Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\n\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\n\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead,\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's\nSkeleton,\" a r\u00f4le in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\n\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\nas a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\n        +------------------------------------+\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\n        +------------------------------------+\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\nfor me an 'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\n\n\nCHAPTER: IV\n\n\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\n\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\nusual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\nslipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\nHeadless Earl.\"\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\nCanterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o'clock in\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\n\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's\nRecollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then,\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\nown first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the Sieur de\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\nVirginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\n\n\nCHAPTER: V\n\n\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\nspoke to him.\n\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\nexisting.\"\n\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.\"\n\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\n\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\nI couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\nin England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this\nkind.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should like America.\"\n\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\nsatirically.\n\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\nyour manners.\"\n\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's\nholiday.\"\n\n\"Please don't go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.\"\n\n\"That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\n\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\nVirginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\nup into his old withered face.\n\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\nsleep?\"\n\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.\"\n\nVirginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\nwith the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death's\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\nis.\"\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\nthe wind.\n\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\n\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\n\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\nare only six lines:\n    \"'When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.'\n\n\"But I don't know what they mean.\"\n\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\ncannot prevail.\"\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\n\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\n\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\nChamber was empty.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VI\n\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\n\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\nout the boy, \"but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\n\nPlease don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back,\nwill you? I can't go! I won't go!\"\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\nCecil, if you won't go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\ncommon, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\nabout eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\n\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\n\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\n\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.\"\n\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\n\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck, and kissed her.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VII\n\n\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\nword during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi\u00e6valism\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\naisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\nEngland.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\nSimon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\n\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\n\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\n\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\n\n\"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\nhim a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.\"\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\n\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won't you?\"\n\nVirginia blushed.",
                "-IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.\n\n\nIT is vain to dispute the fact that those Puritan Fathers\u2014who, upon one\noccasion, held a meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the\nLord\u2019s, and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of\nthe saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were, therefore,\njustified in depriving the natives of their grounds, and in taking\npossession of them themselves\u2014had a full share of that English faculty of\nappropriation which has made England the mistress of the seas, and for a\nwhile, almost, the ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say\nthat on the whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British\nflag in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the\ncommunities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation itself.  In some\ncases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly; in some cases the lives and\nhappiness of millions have been placed in incompetent hands; in some\ncases we have had selfish rulers and incapable officers; but India and\nCanada and the West Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the\nbetter for our rule.  An Englishman may well be proud of what his\ncountrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no narrow,\ncarping, and censorious spirit.  We have spent money by millions, but\nthen we are rich, and the expenditure has not been an unproductive one.\n\nWe have sacrificed valuable lives, but the men who have fallen have been\nembalmed in the nation\u2019s memory, and the story of their heroism will\nmould the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of\nour children\u2019s children, as they did those of our fathers in days gone\nby; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake responsibilities beyond\nour means, and find ourselves engaged in contests utterly needless in the\ncircumstances of the case, and certain to result in a vain effusion of\nblood and expenditure of money.  As far as South Africa is concerned,\nthis is emphatically the case.  Originally the Cape Settlement was but a\nfort for the the coast.  The country is subject to drought, and seems\nchiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich farmers, and wool\ngrowers.  Its great agricultural resources are undeveloped, because\nlabour is dear, and all carriage to the coast is expensive.  The English\nnever stop in the colonies, but return to England as soon as they have\nmade a fortune.  Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts\ndearer.  In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all classes are\nriding, driving, shooting, and billiards.  In the interior there are fine\nviews to be seen, and in some quarters an abundance of game.  The\nthunderstorms are frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in\nwinter.  The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and the Kaffirs,\nare a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.  \u201cAlthough South Africa is\na rising colony,\u201d writes Sir Arthur Cunynghame, \u201cI hardly think it offers\nto the emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New\nZealand.  South Africa is not a very rich country.  Labour is hard to\nobtain, and it will be years before irrigation can be carried on a\nsufficient scale to make agriculture a brilliant Success.  Nevertheless,\nland is so abundant that the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to\nmake a living, and provided he does not drink, has a good chance of\nbecoming a rich man.\u201d  A great deal of money is made by ostrich farming\nand sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require capital.  As to\ncereals, it pays better to buy them than to grow them.  A cabbage appears\nto be a costly luxury, and the price of butter is almost prohibitive.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa,\u201d wrote a Saturday Reviewer recently, \u201cis the paradise of\nhunters, and the purgatory of colonists.\u201d  The remark is not exactly\ntrue, but for all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.  If\nthis be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have been so\nanxious to get possession of the country?  The answer is, We hold the\nCape of Good Hope to be desirable as a port of call and harbour of refuge\non our way to India; but the opening of the Suez Canal has changed all\nthat, and the reason for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not\nexist now.  Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape remains\nto be proved.\n\nIn taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there a people\nwhom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we have made bitter\nenemies.  These were the original Dutch settlers, or Boers, a primitive,\npastoral people, with a good deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers,\nand who set to work to exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of\nthe Jews, of whom we read in the Old Testament.  Their plan of getting\nrid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.  They either made\nthe native a slave, or they drove him away.  Mr. Thomas Pringle, one of\nour earliest colonists, says, \u201cTheir demeanour towards us, whom they\nmight be supposed naturally to regard with exceeding jealousy, if not\ndislike, was more friendly and obliging than could, under all the\ncircumstances, have been expected.\u201d  They were, he says, uncultivated,\nbut not disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;\nbut they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the custom of the\ncountry, extremely hospitable; and the same testimony has been borne to\nthem by later travellers.  They lived as farmers, and the life agreed\nwith them.  The men are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might\nbe raised.  In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the British yoke.  A\nHottentot, named Booy, appeared at the magistrate\u2019s office at Cradock,\nand complained of the oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of\nFrederick Bezuidenhout.  Inquiry was accordingly made.  The Boer admitted\nthe facts, but, instead of yielding to the magistrate\u2019s order, he boldly\ndeclared that he considered this interference between himself and his\nHottentot to be a presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an\nintolerable usurpation of authority.  He told the field-cornet that he\nset at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him on this\nofficious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his words, he fell\nviolently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe beating, and then bade him go\nand tell the civil authorities that he would treat them in the same\nmanner if they should dare to come upon his grounds to claim the property\nof a Hottentot.  It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed\nover to us, without their leave or without their consent being in any way\nasked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life and limb\nof every Hottentot under his control.  It was only thus he believed his\nproperty was safe, and his throat uncut.  But to return to Bezuidenhout.\n\nThe Cape Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.  An\nexpedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.  The affair excited\na great sensation in the country.  At a numerous assemblage of the Boers\nin the neighbourhood, it was resolved to revenge his death.  They did\nmore; they resolved to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but,\nit is needless to add, in vain.  England, after putting down Napoleon,\nand triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied by a handful of\nDutch farmers in a distant quarter of the globe.  But the Cape Government\nhad Kaffir wars to fight, and they could not afford to treat the Boers as\nabsolute enemies, and they were rewarded with a large portion of the\nterritory, won from the Kaffirs in 1819.  But this was not sufficient for\ntheir earth-hunger.  They crossed the boundaries, and, with their lives\nin their hands, planted themselves among the savages.  In 1838 they went\noff still further from British rule.  In that year the slaves were\nmanumitted, and a sum of money was voted as a compensation to the Boers.\n\nTo the shame of the British Government, it must be confessed that the\nequivalent was never paid them.  Despairing of ever receiving it, they\nsold their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the\ncountry into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the Transvaal.  It is because we have followed them there,\nwhen there was no need to have done so, that we are now engaged in a\ncostly and bloody war.  First we seized Natal; then we took possession of\nthe Diamond Fields, and our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.\n\nHow far this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to say.\n\nIt is equally impossible to state what will be its cost in treasure and\nin men.  It seems equally difficult to say upon whom the blame of this\nannexation system rests.  It really seems as if we were villains, as\nShakespeare says, by necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.  We\nshould have left the Boers alone.  They were not British subjects, and\ndid not want to be such.  Natal was not British territory when they\nsettled there, neither was the Orange Free State Territory; and, at any\nrate, in 1854 their independence, which had been persistently fought for,\nand nobly won, was acknowledged by the British Government as regards the\nOrange Free State and the Transvaal.  Surely in South Africa there was\nroom for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for the\ndream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of our colonial\nrulers, the two nations might have lived and flourished side by side.\n\nThe Boer, at any rate, has made himself at home on the soil.  It agrees\nwith him physically.  In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made good\nroads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned the\nwilderness into a fruitful field.  In reply to the English who pleaded\nfor annexation, he said, \u201cWe fled from you years ago; leave us in peace.\n\nWe shall pay our debts early enough; your presence can but tend to\nincrease them, and to drive us through fresh wanderings, through new\nyears of bloodshed and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer\nfollow us.  We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits of that\nconquest.  What have you done for that colony?  Do you seek to do with\nour Transvaal as you have done with it, to make our land a place of\nabomination, defiled with female slavery, reeking with paganism, and\nlikely, as Natal is, only too soon to be red with blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Transvaal,\u201d wrote one who knew South Africa well\u2014the late Mr. Thomas\nBaines\u2014\u201cwill yet command the admiration of the world for the\nperseverance, the primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.\u201d  As\na proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its one-pound\nnotes had risen in value till four were taken for a sovereign, and\nseveral hundred pounds\u2019 worth had been called in and publicly burnt upon\nthe market-place.  It is a proof of the simplicity of the people that on\nthat occasion the Boers and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully\naround, and bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in\nwickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while others,\nof more advanced views, discussed the means of raising them still further\nin value, and sagely remarked that because they had been printed in\nHolland the English would not take them, but that if others were printed\nin London they would certainly be as good as a Bank of England note.  In\nthe Volksraad (House of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes\noccurred.  The progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure\nfor the opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,\nfinding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by bringing\nforward an old law that all members should be attired in black cloth\nsuits and white neckerchiefs.  This had the immediate effect of\ndisqualifying so many that the business of the House could not be legally\nconducted; but an English member who lived next door, slipped out, donned\nhis Sunday best, with a collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and\nresumed his sitting with an army that completely dismayed the\nanti-progressionists.  The latest authority, Sir Arthur Cunynghame,\ntestifies to this simplicity as still the characteristic of the Dutch.\n\n\u201cSome little time before our arrival,\u201d he writes, \u201ca German conjurer had\nvisited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so alarmed at\nhis tricks that they left the room in which he was exhibiting, and,\nassembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved of the devil who had come\namongst them.\u201d  He tells the story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer\nhad made a miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his\nready-reckoner.  Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite replied,\n\u201cOh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!\u201d and the poor Boer was done.\n\nA further illustration of their simplicity is to be found in the fact\nthat when they trekked from the Cape they fancied that they were on their\nway to Egypt, and, having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river\nwhich falls into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the\nNyl\u2014a name which it still retains.  In accordance with their serious\nteaching, they gave Scriptural names to their settlements and villages;\nand if they were severe on the natives, and ruled them with a rod of\niron, did not the Jews act in a similar manner to the Hivites and the\nHittites, and did not Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before\nthe Lord?\n\nIt is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done to them by\nour rulers.  We had no claim on them.  It was to escape British rule that\nthey, with their wives and children, their men-servants and\nmaid-servants, their oxen, and their sheep, their horses and their asses,\nwent forth into the wilderness.  Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they\ntook possession of Natal, \u201cthere was hardly a native to be seen, the\ncountry having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.  It was the very\nplace for the Dutch, fertile without interference, and with space for\nevery one.\u201d  There they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on\nthe other side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we\nfollowed them, and drove them away.  If they had been allowed to remain,\nthe English Government and the English people would have been saved a\ngood deal of trouble.  At any rate, we should never have heard of the\nnative difficulty in Natal\u2014the difficulty which keeps away the emigration\nrequired to develop the resources of a country happily situated in many\nrespects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a handful of English\nin the presence of a horde of polygamous and untutored savages who will\nnot work, and who, alas! are not ashamed to beg.  Natal, had the Dutch\nbeen left peaceably in possession of it, would have been by this time the\nhome of a God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with\nPagans who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and\nwho learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.  In Natal,\nthe English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in their own\nlanguage.  Where the Boers hold sway it is otherwise.  In the Dutch parts\nof the Cape Colony, Captain Aylward writes: \u201cThe coloured people are\ntame, submissive, and industrious, speaking the language of their\ninstructors and natural masters.  As I proceeded further on my journey\nthrough the Transvaal,\u201d continues the same writer, \u201cI saw in various\ndirections gardens, fruitful orchards, and small, square houses in the\npossession of blacks, who were living in a condition of ordinary\npropriety, having abandoned polygamy and other horrid customs resulting\nfrom it.  So great an improvement I had not noticed during any part of my\nprevious residence in Natal.\u201d  It is a pity that we have made the Boers\nour enemies; and the worst of it is, in their determination not to be\nEnglish the women, according to Captain Aylward, have been a wonderful\naid to the men.  They have suffered for that spirit.  It has called them\nfrom the homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the\ngrapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were white for\nthe harvest.  In 1841 Major Charteris wrote: \u201cThe spirit of dislike to\nEnglish rule was remarkably dominant among the women.  Many of those who\nhad formerly lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and\nsubject to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in\nwhich they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands and\nbrothers by the savage, still rejected with scorn the idea of returning\nto the colony.  If any of the men began to drop or lose courage they\nurged them on to fresh exertions, and kept alive the spirit of resistance\nwithin them.\u201d  Sir Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the\nBoers.  On his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he\nsays, \u201chas a grand appearance, the Dutch minister\u2019s house, standing in\nthe centre, being quite a palace.  It was built by the subscriptions of\nhis parishioners.  The honours which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are\nworthy of remark.\u201d  Equally worthy of remark is their hospitality and\ntheir piety.  The farmer gives his guest the best entertainment he can\nprovide, and \u201cbefore the family retires to rest the large Bible is opened\nand the chapter appropriate to the day is read.\u201d  On another occasion,\nSir Arthur\u2019s party encamp near the residence of a rich Dutch farmer, who\nrefused admission to his house and would not even sell them an egg; yet\nhe records the fact that, \u201clate in the evening the sounds of the Evening\nHymn floated over the plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being\ndistinctly heard leading the choir, while female voices, with their\nplaintive notes, chimed in.  It is pleasant,\u201d adds Sir Arthur, \u201cto hear\nin these lone lands such evidence of a religions sentiment pervading the\ncommunity, and it is an assurance that the people are contented and\nhappy.\u201d  Sir Arthur writes:\u2014\u201cThere are no finer young men in the world\nthan the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height and size,\nand very hardy.  Their life is spent in the open air by day, and\nfrequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with no tent or covering.\n\nMen more fit for the Grenadier Guards, as to personal appearance, could\nnot be found.  Some of them are plucky.  A Boer had part of his hand\nblown off by the bursting of his gun.  Having no doctor near, he directed\nhis son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his fingers.\u201d  As\nan Irishman, Captain Aylward is enthusiastic as regards the personal\ncharms of the ladies.  Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not\nuncomely, and in the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us,\nare to be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,\nwhose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful, adorning, and\ncheering the homes of their husbands and children.  These people are\nsomewhat unlettered, and very phlegmatic.  \u201cThey do not wish,\u201d writes Sir\nArthur Cunynghame, \u201cto move ten miles from their own door, nor to see one\nwho comes from ten miles beyond it.\u201d  Their moral discipline also seems\nsomewhat severe.  \u201cIn the little fort,\u201d writes Captain Aylward, \u201cwas an\nEnglish storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters had a piano, on which\nthey would occasionally play dance and other profane music.  This was a\nsource of great annoyance to their pious neighbours, who, in many\nrespects, resembled our early Puritans.  It was requested that the piano\nshould be silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if\npersisted in during a time of war and trial.  If a girl in the laager\nwere frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable to be arrested,\nand brought for trial before the Fathers of the Church, from whom she\nmight receive a severe caution, or even the punishment of removal.\u201d  At\nLydenberg, at the time of Sir Arthur\u2019s visit, an altercation had taken\nplace on the unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by\nthe Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal formed an\nimportant epoch in the history of the town.  To show how primitive these\nBoers are, let us take the following story:\u2014A schoolmaster was lately\nappointed in Zoutspanberg.  One of his earliest lessons was to teach the\nchildren that the world turned upon its own axis.  He also endeavoured to\nmake them understand the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.  The\nchildren went home, and were impertinent to their parents, and told them\nthat the earth went round the sun.  The elders of the district met, and\nconsulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to refer the\nsubject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster to explain.  The\nschoolmaster said, \u201cI teach them nothing but the movements of the\nheavenly bodies, and that the earth revolves round the sun.\u201d  The\nminister answered, \u201cWell, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth\ndoes in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the\nZoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth for a\nfew years longer.  We do not like sudden changes in such matters.\u201d  The\nschoolmaster took the hint, and the sun continued to go round the earth\nas usual.  The power of the minister of a parish is very great.  A great\ndeal depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the town.\n\nMany a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he observed that a town was\nflourishing, \u201cYes, we are fortunate in our minister;\u201d and when it was\nfalling back it was, \u201cAh! all will alter when we get rid of our present\nminister.\u201d\n\nIt is to the credit of these people that they have a consistent native\npolicy.  No faith is to be held with Rome.  \u201cDelenda est Carthago\u201d is\ntheir motto.  They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves, while\nour English policy has been to play off one petty savage chief against\nanother, and to arm and strengthen the natives with whom we are\nultimately to fight.  The natives see through this, and argue, as Sir\nArthur Cunynghame testifies, that the English fear them, else why, they\nask, do they give them such high wages? or why do the Government allow\nthem to buy arms?  It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo\ninto his present hostile attitude.  He considered that we were his allies\nagainst the Boers, and thought we annexed the Transvaal for him and his\nsavage followers.  Up to the annexation he and the English were on\nfriendly terms.  It seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for\nEnglish rule, and some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger\nand a menace.  No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the\nnatives.  The Free States newspaper complains that \u201cour British\nneighbours have established at the Diamond Fields free trade in guns and\nammunition, in spite of all treaties with the Republic, and even in spite\nof their own professed policy in the Cape Colony.  Griqualand West\npermits the supply of guns and ammunition to the natives\u2014Zulus and\nBasutos\u2014without hindrance, whilst Earl Carnarvon requests all South\nAfrica to meet in a friendly conference, because of the native question\nand Zulu difficulty.  British traders supply Her Majesty\u2019s enemies, and\nour enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any extent, in order that\nthese enemies may be better prepared to fight us when the next struggle\nmay commence; and, worst of all, British commerce, represented by\ncolonial shopkeepers and merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would\nnot for a moment hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and\nRepublican Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in\nguns.\u201d  Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the Imperial policy in\nSouth Africa.  There is little to be said for our dealings with them\nafter they had removed out of our rule.  That we had no right to annex\nthe Diamond Fields, the sum we offered in compensation may be considered\nas fair evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a\ncrime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person and in\npurse.  It has bean shown that the cry for annexation raised was merely\n\u201can ignorant expression of the dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible\nminority\u201d\u2014a set of greedy speculators and disreputable office-seekers,\nwho grossly deceived the English officials, who were not naturally averse\nto the power and prestige a new command would give them.  The Republic\nwas not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.  In the war with\nthe Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope, the Burghers were\neverywhere victorious, nor was it stained with slavery, as, if so, when\nSir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we should have heard of a wholesale\nemancipation; nor was the step taken by the will of the people.  The only\nargument for the step was that we were obliged to take it in order to\nprevent our own house catching fire, and the result has been the\nconflagration we were so anxious to avoid.  Sir Theophilus Shepstone\nannexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the Cape Colony, and\nin Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out; and, lastly, we have the\ntragedy of Isandula.  We shall never be safe till we have the Transvaal,\nargued Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his friends.  Now, argue the latter,\nthat we have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.  This reasoning\nwas irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch dated September\nlast, says, \u201cSo long as Natal and the Transvaal had separate interests,\nthe policy of the chief of the Zulu nation was to play off the former\nagainst the latter. . . .  With the annexation of the Transvaal this\nstate of things virtually came to an end.\u201d\n\nEx uno disce omnes.  One example will suffice of the way in which that\ntheory of dominion universal, from, the Cape to the Zambesi, which\nappears to dominate over the official Englishman, when he has anything to\ndo with Africa, acts in a mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of\nGriqualand East, formerly called No Man\u2019s Land, which was some years\nsince a sort of neutral territory.  In time the Griquas, or bastards,\nsettled there.  They were an industrious people, and far more advanced in\ncivilisation than any other native tribe.  They had large flocks of\ncattle and sheep, and were wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and\nprospered under the rule of their President, Adam Kok.  Many new\nbuildings, such as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir\nArthur Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.  He writes:\n\u201cIn the afternoon we attended the native service carried on in the Dutch\nlanguage.  It was impossible for me to follow it; in fact, the discovery\nthat the sermon related to the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my\nknowledge of what was going on.  The congregation appeared attentive, and\nthe clergyman in earnest.\u201d  Not long after the visit, it was decided by\nthe British that they should annex the country, and Adam Kok was\npensioned off with a thousand a year, which he did not, however, long\nenjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage accident.  At a meeting of the\npeople on the subject, Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had\nevery reason to do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government\nwere assuming authority in his country.  They had their own cannon,\nfire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money, and after being\nleft for thirteen years entirely to their own resources, without any\npreliminary notice he said, the Cape Government stepped coolly in and\ntook possession of them and their property.  When the Government laid out\nthe Kat River Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed,\ncorn, ploughs, and various other things to help them.  But the Griquas\nwere not so treated.  They had to do everything for themselves, and we\nwere bound to regard them not as enemies to be put down, but as friendly\nallies to be encouraged and preserved.\n\nHow long is this system to be pursued?  The Transvaal is getting into a\nworse state every day.  It has vast resources which cannot be developed.\n\nIt is importing flour, when it might be a great corn-producing country.\n\nIt has no manufactures, and its exports are few.  Captain Aylward writes:\n\u201cThe Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.  They say our\nliberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our country annexed,\nnot only against the will of the majority, but in utter defiance of Lord\nCarnarvon\u2019s instructions, which state that no such proclamation shall be\nissued by you (Sir Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain\nthat the inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,\ndesire to become our subjects.\u201d  The Boers also object to the annexation,\nbecause they believe that the arguments put forward by Sir Theophilus\nShepstone are not borne out by facts, and they are still more angry\nbecause they believe the annexation was brought about by false pretences,\naccompanied and strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and\ncharacter by a party Press interested in their destruction.  They say\nfurther, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not been\nadhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the country,\nappeals to England to do them justice and restore to them their country.\n\nThe railway party who want a connection with the natural outlet of the\nTransvaal, Delagoa Bay, are discontented, and so are the very men who\nwere the first to applaud annexation.  As it is, it seems, the Transvaal\nmust end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden on\nthe British taxpayer for many years to come.  Mr. Trollops himself admits\nthat it is not easy to justify what we have done in the Transvaal.  \u201cIf\nthere be,\u201d he writes, \u201cany laws of right and wrong, by which nations\nshould govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it is hard\nto find the law in conformity with which that act was done.\u201d  And Mr.\nTrollope is right.  Undoubtedly it was an act of injustice of which we\nhave not yet seen the bitter end.  There is little chance of that\ninjustice being undone.  The Dutch are poor and far away.  It is the old,\nold story of the wolf and the lamb over again.  We have made so little of\nSouth Africa, we might leave the Boers alone.  All that we can say\nagainst them is that when it was the fashion for West Indian planters to\nmaltreat their slaves, they often did the same.\n\nThe Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may, and there is\nno sign of this discontent ceasing.  In the beginning of February they\nheld a large meeting at Wonderfontein to receive the report of the visit\nof the deputation, Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.  The latter is\nreported to have said:\u2014\u201cMy brethren and fellow-countrymen,\u2014I am very glad\nto see you all spared by God in this our beloved country.  I wish and\nhope the best, also, with regard to your families.  You have deputed us\non a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.  I know you are\nawaiting our report with deep anxiety.  I know your feelings and your\nwishes\u2014aye, I share your anxiety, and, therefore, I will not detain you\nlong by words.  Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as\nyou had expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged\nyour rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb, be\nstrong and possess the country which God has given you.  No, brethren,\nEngland has annexed your country, and will keep it, and I may not mislead\nyou by not telling you that you cannot stop the superior power of\nEngland.  Therefore, take heed for yourselves, and don\u2019t do anything of\nwhich you may repent for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your\nfamilies, and others into deeper misery still.  Pray to God for wisdom;\nbe prudent, and act wisely.  Who knows, God may help us and grant relief.\n\nYou had sent us to ask back your independence.  What we have done for it\nyou already know from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from\nthe books or pamphlets which we had printed.  In how far you will decide\nthat we have done our duty we leave to you.  I do not care for myself,\nbut I do for the country, and the people, and where I feel my own\nshortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied before God and my conscience\nthat I, if I have not obtained what you, what I, and the people have\ndesired, I have done for it what I could.  And with this I wish God\u2019s\ngreatest blessing for yourselves and the country.\u201d  Other speeches were\ndelivered of a more angry and exciting character.  It was intimated that\nwe got our Empire by robbery.  Mr. W. Pretorious said the High\nCommissioner promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his\nindependence.  Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic cheers, England\nmight annex and oppress them, but it could never give them an English\nheart.  Some resolutions were moved, of which the following was one:\u2014\u201cThe\ncommittee, supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of\nthe English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to continue to\nprotest against the injustice committed, and, further, to devise ways and\nmeans with the people for attaining their object.\u201d  After the meeting,\nsome people having torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle\nFrere\u2019s letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,\nand requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.  On the Sunday\nreligious services were held, and on Monday a further meeting took place.\n\nUltimately it was resolved, \u201cThat the committee, having learned the\nopinion of the people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed\nwish of the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by\nthe protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee a deputation to\nacquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to assure His\nExcellency of their full co-operation for the advancement of the whole of\nSouth Africa, provided the annexation be rescinded.\u201d  Clearly, when we\nhave settled with Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free\npeople of the Transvaal.  According to the Natal Mercury, we had better\nleave them alone.\n\nThe following, says the Natal Witness, is a translation of the oath of\nmutual allegiance taken by a great number of respectable Transvaal Boers\nat the Wonderfontein meeting.  It will strike most people that this oath\nis the oath of men who are to be respected.  It will also strike them\nthat such men are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the\nEnglish nation:\u2014\u201cIn the presence of Almighty God, the Searcher of hearts,\nand praying for His gracious assistance and mercy, we, burghers of the\nSouth African Republic, have solemnly agreed, for us and for our\nchildren, to unite in a holy covenant, which we confirm with a solemn\noath.  It is now forty years ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony\nto become a free and independent people.  These forty years were forty\nyears of sorrow and suffering.  We have founded Natal, the Orange Free\nState, and the South African Republic, and three times has the English\nGovernment trampled on our liberty.  And our flag, baptized with the\nblood and tears of our fathers, has been pulled down.  As by a thief in\nthe night has our free Republic been stolen from us.  We cannot suffer\nthis and we may not.  It is the will of God that the unity of our fathers\nand the love to our children should oblige us to deliver unto our\nchildren, unblemished, the heritage of our fathers.  It is for this\nreason that we here unite, and give each other the hand as men and\nbrethren, solemnly promising to be faithful to our country and people,\nand looking unto God, to work together unto death for the restoration of\nthe liberty of our Republic.  So truly help us, God Almighty.\u201d\n\nTill Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men ridiculed\nthe idea of another Kaffir war.  Now all is changed.  The following is an\nextract from a letter, dated February 12, received by a gentleman in\nLondon from a well-known merchant at the Cape:\u2014\u201cWho is responsible for\nthe fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?  This is now\nthe question of all questions; but we fear that it will drop out of\nsight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated here during the late\nso-called war have done.  The Zulus will, of course, be crushed, as\n\u2018Might is Right\u2019 seems now to be England\u2019s motto.  Sir Bartle Frere and\nLord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and for the\nconsequences of the tragedy they have caused.  Never was there a greater\nmistake than the Frere-Sprigg native policy.  We have not right on our\nside, and we have not the force to carry it out, even if we had.  We have\nmade enemies of the loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the\nZulus, and of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust\ntreatment of them.  The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as Governor, and\nof Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the greatest misfortunes which\nhave befallen this country for fifty years.\u201d\n\nThe South African correspondent of the Daily News, writing from\nMaritzburg, March 2, says:\u2014\u201cIt is now only too evident to every one that\nSir Bartle Frere\u2019s policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon\nSouth African interests.  More has been done since he landed at Capetown,\ntwo years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement than, it is to be\nfeared, can be undone for many years to come.  Friendly tribes have been\nexasperated; colonists have been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would\nseem that the High Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and\nfinal evil, by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.\n\nThere is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa that the\nannexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.  When that act took place\nit met with very wide approval, for two reasons\u2014first, because it was\nbelieved that the majority of the Boers were consenting parties; and\nnext, because it was believed that the act might tend to bring the two\ngreat European nationalities closer together.  The return of the second\nTransvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the majority of\nthe Boers were by no means consenting parties.  They complain, too, and\njustly, that not one of the promises made at the time of the annexation\nhas been fulfilled.  If the acts of the annexation were repealed, and\ntime allowed for the bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there\nis little doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some\nsort of confederation with the other South African States, and there can\nbe no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the Free State, whose\ncapital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as the natural capital of\nSouth Africa, would come in also.\u201d\n\nWhat is to be the end of our system of annexation in South Africa?  Our\nConsuls far away from the healthy criticism of the English Press, and\npossibly better trained in ancient than modern history, dream imperial\ndreams, and the public at home applauds when a magnificent success crowns\ntheir work.  In the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure,\nand he will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the\nIrishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for the\nopposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he was \u201cagain\nall Government,\u201d see in the failure the hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and\nhold him up to scorn and contempt.  It is clear what has been done at the\nCape is only in accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not\nmerely there, but in every quarter of the globe.  We could not leave the\nBoers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the surrounding savages.\n\nWe must follow them over desert and plain and swamp and river and rock\nand bush.  The colonist reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a\npolicy, for he made profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and\nthere was a refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have\nbeen dried up.  The Book of Nature might say, Leave the Boers and the\nsavages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the Book of Nature is a\nblank, and the passions and prejudices, and fears and hopes, of the\npassing hour are the only considerations by which the public and the\npuppets it places in office are moved.  Some of us still talk of the New\nTestament; but he who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said\nthe prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way on\nnational policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or Major\nO\u2019Gorman.  Meanwhile time will solve the problem\u2014the storm will blow\nover.  The mob and the pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes\nwho have crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf\nand on that of his people the British power, and the British public will\nhave to pay the bill\u2014not, unfortunately, the hard-working, over-taxed\nworking man; he is a myth, as much so as a mermaid or a griffin; but that\nlarge middle-class, on whom the tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who\nhave been shorn so often that it has become to them a second nature; who\nhave been the mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under\nthe weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct race.\n\n\nCHAPTER: OUR KAFFIR WARS.\n\n\nWRITING last year, Captain Aylward, in his work on the Transvaal,\nindicated that South Africa would be a burning question for the British\ntaxpayer in the summer of 1879.  That period of time has not yet arrived,\nbut already the question has come home to the aggrieved individual\naforesaid in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.  In spite of\ninstructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an aggressive war\non the Zulu nation which already represents an expenditure of a million\nand a half, and which, before it is fought out to the bitter end, will\noccasion the expenditure of a much larger sum.  In a time of unexampled\ncommercial distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate;\nwhen tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and comfort\nhave been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired old men have\nfound themselves after the struggle of a life made paupers; when the most\nthe majority of us can do is to meet the inevitable expenditure of the\npassing day\u2014we are committed, in accordance with the Imperial instincts\nof officials in high quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell\nthe result or calculate the cost.  This, alas! is no new thing where our\nSouth African colonies are concerned.  A war is begun by a blundering\nruler, or in accordance with the wishes of interested parties, and the\nignorant public at home has to pay the bill.  Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in\nhis last work, expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in\nexistence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not have to\npay; nevertheless, in the Budget \u00a3344,000 are put down for the Transkei\nwar.  Mr. Trollope goes a step further, and plainly shows that the\ncolonist, whether as farmer or labourer or trader, is much better off\nthan men of the same class at home, and that it is unjust we should be\ntaxed by an immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.\n\nSpeaking of the Transvaal, he adds, \u201cGreat as is the parliamentary\nstrength of the present Ministry, Parliament would hardly endure the idea\nof paying permanently for the stability and security of a Dutch\npopulation out of the British pocket.\u201d  And yet in Natal the Daily News\ncorrespondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost twelve\nmillions.  It is to be questioned whether we as a people have been\npecuniarly benefited by South African colonies.  They offer no such\nadvantages as a field of emigration as New Zealand or Canada or\nAustralia.  The emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes\nelsewhere.  If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should\nhave had fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much\nmore flourishing condition.  Nor should we have been trembling, as we\nhave of late, lest any morning we might hear the Zulu army had marched\ninto Natal and had not left a white man alive to tell the tale of the\nterrible tragedy that ensued.  I maintain there would be no end to these\nKaffir scares and Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother\ncountry are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are\nallowed to rush into war.  If a man goes to live in South Africa he\nshould do so with the feeling that he runs a certain risk, and that\nknowledge would make him live on good terms with the natives.  High\ninterest, as the late Duke of Wellington is reported to have said, means\nbad security.  In a similar manner, we may say, cheap land means bad\nsecurity; and the farmer who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for\nless than the rent he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as\nsecure in purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.  In 1811 was\nour first Kaffir war.  It was waged on our part in the most cruel\nmanner\u2014no quarter was given by the white man\u2014no prisoners taken\u2014all were\nslaughtered till the Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across\nthe Great Fish River.  In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be\nexpected.  Wars lead to wars.  What the sword wins the sword only can\nretain.  Lord Charles Somerset, who had Imperial ideas of the most\npronounced character, took it into his head to elect Gaika as the sole\nhead of Kaffirland, when in reality the paramount chief was Hintza.  In\n1818, by seizing the wife of one of the latter\u2019s chief councillors, and\nother aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his\nsuperior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great slaughter.\n\nAfter the defeat Gaika appealed to the British Government to assist him,\nnot in bringing about a reconciliation, but in making war on his enemies.\n\nAccordingly a powerful force of regular troops and armed colonists, to\nthe number of 3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight\non behalf of this wretched savage.  The reward of their valour consisted\nin more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of the finest were\ngiven to the colonists and the rest to Gaika.  As a natural consequence,\nthe plundered tribes, rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish\nRiver in great numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled\nthe border colonists to abandon their dwellings.  Additional troops were\nsent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the re-invasion of\nKaffirland.  But before that plan was carried out, the Kaffirs, to the\nnumber of 9,000, led by Makanna, attacked Grahamstown, and would have\ntaken it had not the leader, in accordance with the custom of the heroes\nof his country, sent a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the\nBritish commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.  This\ngave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400 Kaffirs were\nleft dead on the field.  After this Colonel Willshire and Landdrost\nStockenstrom advanced into the enemy\u2019s country, carrying fire and\nslaughter everywhere.  At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for his\npeople, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the English; but\nthis act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded to drive away the\nKaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of fertile territory.  The\nKaffir, of course, became more incensed against us than ever.  He saw his\nlands taken away, and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but\nfor a while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional brushes\nin consequence of cattle stealing, real or pretended.  There is a foray\nrecorded in the Cape Government Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious\naffair.  At daybreak on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his\nforce, passed with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the\nsatisfaction of pouring into the centre of Makanna\u2019s kraal with a\nrapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the Kaffirs.  A\nfew assegais were thrown, but the attack was made with such vigour that\nlittle resistance could be made.  As many Kaffirs having been destroyed\nas it was thought would evince our superiority and power, Major Somerset\nstopped the slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about\n7,000 head.\n\nStrange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the fact of our\nsuperiority and power only made matters worse, and the commissioners of\ninquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that the annexation had entailed\nexpenses upon the Government and sacrifices upon the people in no degree\ncompensated with the acquirement of the territory which was the object of\nit.  A similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a\ncolony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the mother\ncountry with a hostile tariff.  It seems then, as now, nothing was easier\nthan to get up a casus belli.  Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African\ntraveller, illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to\nthe natives by some of our colonists.  \u201cI was speaking to a friend,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201crespecting the new discoveries, and we both agreed that it would\nbe wrong to make war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from\nthem.\u201d  \u201cBut,\u201d said my friend, \u201cI would work with foresight.  I would\nsend cattle farmers to graze their herds near the borders, and the\nKaffirs would be sure to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come\naway, and he could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and\nday, then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.  We could go in\nand claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted and made war,\nof course they would lose their country.\u201d\n\nOur next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable to\nourselves.  The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope, bloody, but\nruinous to thousands.  The cattle were of course destroyed, so that no\none was enriched.  Of the ill blood then engendered the effects still\nremain.  Three hundred thousand pounds were spent by the British.  But at\nlast the Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin\nD\u2019Urban triumphant.  Lord Glenelg himself, however, declared that the\nKaffirs had \u201cample justification.\u201d  It seems to an impartial observer\nthat the war was entirely brought about by the English.  After his\nexpulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika, retired to the\nbanks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating his people to plunder\nthe colony, he appears to have done his best to restrain them.  On that\nhead we have abundant testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to\nhave him and his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under\nreally aggravating circumstances.  Our own soldiers did their work well,\nand we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined cultivations,\nand people driven away like wild beasts.  The chief was sulky, writes\nColonel Wade, and well he might be.  Another cause of the war was the\nfrontier system, which constantly led to collisions with the natives.  As\nthe Chief Tyalie declared, \u201cEvery year a commando comes, every week a\npatrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our cattle.\u201d  It was then\nthe infuriated natives swept over the colony, to be in turn driven back.\n\nThe murder of the great chief Hintza appears to have been an\nextraordinarily brutal one.  It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,\n\u201cthat Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the Hottentots present\ngranted the boon, and abstained from killing him; that this office was\nthen undertaken by Mr. Southey, and that then the dead body of the fallen\nchief was basely and inhumanly mutilated.\u201d\n\nUnder Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.  Almost his\nfirst act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir eyes\u2014the erection\nof a fort in their territory.  As they said in their own expressive\nlanguage, the new chief smelt of war, and war soon came.  A Kaffir stole\nan axe; he was sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.  The\nchief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such offences\nwere to be tried at Fort Beaufort.  The plea was in vain\u2014the man was\nsent; an attempt was made to rescue him, and a Hottentot policeman was\nshot.  At once the English took the field to avenge the insult in blood.\n\nIn 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one advanced\nmilitary village after another were murdered.  This went on for nearly\ntwo years, but was at last suppressed by dint of hard fighting.  It cost\nGreat Britain, wrote Mr. Trollope, upwards of two millions of money, with\nthe lives of about four hundred fighting men.\n\nOur Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir George Napier\nin 1841.  At first the war went very much in favour of the Dutch.  Then a\nlarger force came, and the Dutch succumbed to numbers.  It was not,\nhowever, till 1843 that the twenty-four still existing members of the\nVolksraad declared Her Majesty\u2019s Government to be supreme.  In the case\nof the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in our beating the\nDutch and winning the place, only to relinquish it again.  Our rule in\nNatal led to our little war with King Langalibalele, who had come to live\nin Natal as king of the Hlubi tribe, who is now living, after a good many\nlives had been lost, near Capetown at an expense to the Government of\n\u00a3500 a year.  In England it was felt that the chief had been unfairly\nused, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with over-strained\nrigour, and the punishment to have been too severe.  There would have\nbeen no war at all had it not been for the blunders of mischievous\ngo-betweens.  And now once more we are at war, and a cry has been raised\nfor the extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,\nthere will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new lands to\nbe annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the colonists will\nmake fortunes out of the millions thus spent.  I ask in sorrow, How long\nis England to be strained and denuded of men and money for these costly\nwars?  Surely it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and\nstatesmanship of our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent\nway.\n\nA PLEA FOR THE KAFFIR.\n\nAT the present moment we are witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian\nnation\u2014that of a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa,\nwaiting to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and\nthe most scientific instruments of murder England has at her command.\n\nTheir crime has been that in defending their native soil from the tread\nof the foe, they annihilated an English regiment, and for such an act\nthere is no hope of pardon, in this world at least.  From every corner of\nthe land, from the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and\nthe palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the\nstatesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge; and that\nwe shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no doubt.  Already\nin England and in Africa the blood-stained demon of war has sown her seed\nand reaps her harvest; already there have been bitter tears shed over\nhundreds of fallen heroes in desolated homes, and women wail and children\nvainly cry for loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of\nIsandula.  And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet to come if\nthe wild instincts of the people are to be gratified and the Zulu Kaffirs\nare to be exterminated.  They are now represented as savage hordes, whose\nexistence is incompatible with English rule.  Let me plead that they are\nnot such as they are represented, and that it is better that we make them\nfriends.  Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping with fire and\nslaughter through Natal when that colony lay stricken and terrified at\nhis feet, has set us an example of forbearance which it were wise to\nimitate.  If we fail to do so, the blood feud between us and his people\ncan know no end.  They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and\nthe Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than any we\nhave hitherto known.\n\nThere is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly with the\nEnglish people if fairly treated.  One well-known writer states that they\nare keen observers of character, and have great contempt for a man who\ngets drunk, or who does not keep his word.  Kaffirs should be treated\nwith kindness, fairness, and firmness.  They have an accurate idea of\njustice, and appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.\nWilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.  In their wild state they\nare innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and it is only when\nthey live close to a European town that they acquire the bad habits of\nthe white race, and with the cunning instincts natural to them become\ndangerous to the community.  Said another colonist, at a conference\nrecently held at the African section of the Society of Arts, mentally\nthey were equal to white men.  Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years\nin Natal, and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that\nthe Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education, seemed a much\nhigher race intellectually than the lower class of the agricultural\npopulation in England.  In fact, he would rather go to a Kaffir for a\nresponse to an appeal to his reason than to an English labourer.  Twenty\nyears ago, said Mr. Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but\nnow they were great customers to the British merchant.  As a further\nproof of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions the\ncase of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his own credit\n\u00a3500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further loan from the Government\nto get it to work, and who, in three years, paid off the loan, and became\na prosperous manufacturer.  It seems a pity to kill off such people\u2014a\npeople by nature intended to be our customers and allies and friends.\n\nMuch more than this may be said.  \u201cKaffirs seem,\u201d writes Lady Barker, \u201ca\nvery gay and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear\nfrom the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road just\noutside our fence.\u201d  A similar testimony was borne by Mr. Robert\nRichardson in a paper read by him a year or two since at a meeting of the\nSociety of Arts.  \u201cThe Zulu,\u201d he said, \u201cmay not be dignified, but\nmanliness and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he\nis not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and performs\nwith alacrity the least honourable service about a house.  If Natal lambs\ndon\u2019t skip, as the Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant\ndoes, for his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings\nwith an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.  Brimful of\nhumour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and having few wants or\ncomforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being jolly under creditable\ncircumstances.  All things considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant\nthan the (Cape) frontier Kaffir.\u201d\n\nThere is much that is good in these Kaffirs.  A correspondent of the\nCape Mercury wrote\u2014\u201cIt is said the Kaffir language has no word for\ngratitude; but, nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.  A\nnative man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey Mr.\nConway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr. Conway being at\nthe time very ill.  Unfortunately, after his arrival, he died, leaving\nhis wife and family not very well off.  The other day the native arrived\nto take home his waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he\ntook it he would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an\nindependent living.  To the astonishment of all present, he said, \u2018I\ndon\u2019t forget good deeds done to me by Conway before poverty overhauled\nhim, and to show that I am sincerely sorry for his family I here make\nyou, his widow, a present of my waggon and gear now in your possession to\nenable you to provide for his children.\u2019  The value of the waggon was\n\u00a360.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by too many\ncolonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.  \u201cThe other day,\u201d says a\nwriter in a Colonial paper called the Independent, \u201ca wheelbarrow\ntumbled over the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a\nKaffir.  His master, with some irritation, inquired of the employer of\nthe careless servant, \u2018Do you want to kill my Kaffirs?\u2019  The reply was an\nindignant query, \u2018What about my wheelbarrow?  It\u2019s smashed, and your\nKaffir isn\u2019t hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut enough of this.  According to all writers the Kaffir is deeply\nimpressed with a sense of English superiority.  Let us now show him our\ntrue superiority; that we war not with him, that we desire not his land,\nthat we are as merciful as we are strong.  Cetewayo\u2019s young men have\nwashed their spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances\nwhich have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu\nbreast.  Have we no wise men among us who can stand between the living\nand the dead, and calm the natural passions of the hour, and stay the\nravages of war?  If there be not such, our task is an endless one to\nfight and conquer, merely to fight and conquer again.  The soldier cannot\nsolve the difficulty; he merely postpones it for a time.\n\nFailing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very undesirable\nalternative.  If we cease to rule by kindness, we must do so by brute\nforce.  Contemplating this delightful state of things, the Natal\nWitness of the 8th of February says:\u2014\u201cCivilisation has become\nunmistakably aggressive.  The result which it was hoped might be gained\nby the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is now\ndestined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle Frere, at the\npoint of the bayonet.  The great herald of peace, whose feet were to be\nso beautiful upon the mountains, has become the genius of war.  Whether\nSir Bartle Frere foresaw this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether\nhe likes his position.  We will not even argue whether he is right or\nwrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.  Judging by\nhistory, we incline to the opinion that he is right, and if he is right,\nthen the hope of producing the social amalgamation we have referred to\nwas a vain hope altogether.  But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us\nnot deceive ourselves about one thing\u2014that it is now extinguished.  The\nship of State has been put about on the other tack, and is at the present\nmoment, it must be owned, making very bad weather of it.  Whatever is now\ndone by way of civilising the native population in South Africa must be\ndone by force.  We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is\nemployed in a pitched battle.  We mean rather this\u2014that the native\npopulation must henceforth be ruled by a show of military strength rather\nthan by trust in British justice or regard for commercial advantages.\n\nThis, we say, may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been\nunavoidable.  But do not let us deceive ourselves about it.  The fact is\nso, and we must make the best of it or the worst.  If the Home Government\nwill be content to keep a large military force in South Africa for thirty\nyears to come, and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if,\nfailing this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the\nprotection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if he does\nnot pay\u2014if all this comes to pass, then for thirty years South Africa\nwill be a place which, though utterly useless as a field for immigration,\na place in which certain classes of people can live.  But then will these\nthings be done?  Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in\nSouth Africa?  Can South Africa pay for them?  And, if South Africa\ncannot, will the British public pay?  These are questions most seriously\naffecting our future, and which for the present we leave to be answered\nby our readers as best they may be able.\u201d  Such is a colonial aspect of\nwhat is emphatically a colonial question.\n\nWe hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt to forget\nthat in South Africa we have any one else to deal with.  In fact the\ncoloured people with whom our whites more or less come into contact, are\nestimated by Mr. Trollope, our best authority on the subject, at\n3,000,000, and with the exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who\ninhabit Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a\nvery superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities, mental and\nphysical.  It is to be questioned whether the danger in the recent system\nof government at the Cape, which places power in the hands of the white\ncolonists alone, is not calculated to create discontent among the\nnumerous and high-spirited people around.  It is much to be regretted\nalso, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and consistent\npolicy with the native tribes.  The great civilising agency of our time\nis the British trader, and at the Kimberley mines he has set the native\nto work; but more than that is required if the native is to be elevated\nand to be taught to take his proper place as a labourer in the great\nharvests of the world.\n\nIf the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that it is\ndivided, into many districts, some of them of immense extent\u2014hundreds of\nmiles apart, and inhabited by peoples under varying rulers, and with\nvarying interests.  The Cape, for instance, has little sympathy with\nNatal, and the great Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.\n\nIn the latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to\nEnglish rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in by\nEnglish dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its own.  A\ngrand South African confederation is a beautiful idea, but there does not\nseem much chance of carrying it out just now.  Meanwhile we go on\nannexing all the surrounding country, much to the discontent of the\nnatives themselves.\n\nAt present the great difficulty is the native population.  According to\nall accounts, they are in an unsettled and agitated state.  Of the\noriginal Hottentot we do not hear much.  Mr. Trollope believes that the\nbulk of the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is\nHottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of independence.  The\nDutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are to be met with in the East and\nWest alike, are not likely to give much trouble; but as we get further\nfrom the Cape, and the white population is sparser, the difficulties\nincrease.  It is true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part\nof Africa bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the\nNorth is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get nearer\nthe Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the Kei, and come\ninto Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in the presence of a native\npopulation, always required to be watched with a careful eye.  There\ndwell the Galekas, who, to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only\nrecently been put down.  They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the\nBomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is reached.\n\nAmongst some of them a British Resident resides; in all they do pretty\nmuch as they like.  Of Natal and its 300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to\nsay more here.  In the same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are\nbastard races.  The Balongas of Thaba \u2019Ncho, who dwell under the shelter\nof the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a branch of the Becuanas,\nwho inhabit that part of the Kalakari desert bordering on Griqualand and\nthe Transvaal.  Of the black African races, the South-Eastern people whom\nwe call Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.  They are not\nconstitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save\nproperty; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the\nvoting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier Mounted\nPolice, says\u2014\u201cAs a nation, they hate the white man, and look forward to\nthe day when he will be expelled from the country.\u201d  Mr. Trollope remarks\nof the native that he is a good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a\nhostile Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion\nshould arise, he would probably be a rebel.  The two names most familiar\nto the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas, who have both given us\na good deal of trouble.  Sandilli with his Gaikas have long been\nsubjected, though they have never been regarded as peaceable as the\nFingos and the Basutos.  The total population of the region beyond the\nKei is stated to be 500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the\nGriquas, all are Kaffirs.\n\nOur special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe originally\ndriven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the Galekas, by whom they\nwere enslaved and regarded as Kaffir dogs.  We English took pity on them,\nreleased them from slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast\nbetween the great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters,\nthe Galekas.  There they were a perpetual eyesore to their former\nmasters.  In the first place, they had for their 50,000 souls 2,000\nsquare miles, while that left for the 66,000 Galekas was not more than\n1,600 miles.  Again, the Fingos have been a money-making people,\npossessing oxen and waggons, and gradually rising in the world.  For a\ntime, as was to be expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing,\nand in 1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.  We rushed into\nthe war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire for a struggle\nwith the English, was beaten, and his country annexed.  The Basutos, who\nhave given up fighting since the days of their great king Moshesh, number\nabout 127,000.  In the map they are now included in the Cape Province,\nbut they border the Orange Free State\u2014lying between it and Kaffraria.  In\n1868 they became, after a wearisome contest with the Dutch, so worried by\nthe latter, that they implored the British to take them as subjects.  The\nBasutos are not Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the\nBalongas, who live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the\nOrange Free State.  As their land is the very best on the Continent for\nagricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs, are great\ngrowers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case with such people,\nare friends of peace and great lovers of money.  At one time they were\ncannibals.  For a long time they were terrible fighters, and that they\nhave become what they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the\ncivilising influences of the trader.  At the same time, it will not be\ndifficult to make enemies of them.  One of their chiefs\u2014Morosi\u2014has,\ntaking advantage of the Zulu war, attempted a little emeute on his own\nhook.  We are glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the\nworst of it.  In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the writer\nsays:\u2014\u201cI wonder the Government are not more active in their movements,\nand send a proper force to crush him at once, as it is believed here that\nif Morosi gets the least advantage the whole of Basutoland will be in a\nblaze.  Sprigg will find that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more\nthan he expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not\nat all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do so\nwithout a struggle.\u201d  The Gaikas who inhabit the district around\nFrankfort and King William\u2019s-town have been British subjects for\nfive-and-twenty years; but it is said that our recent policy has also\nmuch alienated them.  These are the men on whose future relationship\ndepends the fate of South Africa.  Under his own chief in the forest,\nsays Mr. Froude, the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined;\nunder European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood as\nan Irish or English policeman.  It is to our shame that we have left him\nalmost entirely to himself, and that even our missionaries have done\nlittle more than teach him to sing hymns.  Lovedale is, however, an\nimportant testimony to the worth of missionary enterprise when it takes\nan industrious turn.  There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,\nprinting, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all\nsuccessfully carried on.  At King William\u2019s-town young native men,\ntrained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers in attorneys\u2019\noffices, steadily performing their work, and with satisfaction to their\nemployers.  At Edendale the Rev. James Allison commenced a still greater\nwork.  He bought a block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into\nsections suitable to humble purchasers.  These purchasers were natives;\nhis conditions were payment for these lands by instalments, and the\ncomplete surrender of polygamy.  The people are described as industrious\nand prosperous, they subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their\nnumbers increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out\nand purchase land elsewhere.  8,000 acres are thus planted, with 2,000\ninhabitants.  If we are to believe the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, formerly the\nPresbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has the missionary been more\nsuccessful than in South Africa.\n\n           W. SPEAIGHT AND SONS, PRINTERS, FETTER LANE, LONDON.\n\n                              DR. BARNARDO\u2019S\nHOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.\n\n                      (EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.)\n\n\nCHAPTER: URGENT APPEAL.\n\n\nIn the East of London, situated in three parishes, and surrounded by a\ndense population, are the various Institutions comprehended under the\nname of the EAST-END JUVENILE MISSION.  These include the Refuges for\nDestitute and Neglected Children usually called after their founder, \u201cDr.\nBarnardo\u2019s Homes.\u201d\n\nThe East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the sole direction\nof its founder, but during the past few months a Committee has\nundertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial control and general\nadministration.\n\nAs very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate idea of the\ngreat variety of work comprehended by this Mission, or of its weighty\nclaims upon the contributions of the benevolent, we may be permitted to\nbriefly state its more important branches.\n\n1.  The old building known as the HOME FOR WORKING AND DESTITUTE LADS, in\nStepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a new\nbuilding is being reared in the same locality, and when finished the\nwhole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or orphan boys.\n\n2.  DESTITUTE ORPHAN OR NEGLECTED GIRLS are also cared for by this\nMission, and are trained upon the family system, which is, in many\nrespects, preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers\nof female children in one great Institution.  In the VILLAGE HOME at\nIlford there are now twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its\nneighbours, and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for\nthe performance of her important duties.  These Cottages are intended to\ncontain respectively from fifteen to twenty little orphan or destitute\ngirls, who are being trained therein for domestic service.  When the\nVILLAGE is completed and fully occupied there will be thirty Cottages,\ncalculated to contain about 600 such children.\n\n3.  An INFIRMARY FOR SICK CHILDREN, containing thirty beds, has also been\nopened in Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other\nInstitutions.\n\n4.  A most important and practical Temperance work has also been\nestablished and carried on by this Mission.  The first COFFEE PALACE in\nthe Metropolis, the \u201cEdinburgh Castle,\u201d was founded by Dr. Barnardo in\nLimehouse, in February, 1873.  The success which attended it and its\nfellow, the \u201cDublin Castle,\u201d situated in Mile-end, has, in a large\nmeasure, led to the establishment of other Institutions of a similar\ncharacter.\n\n5.  The FREE RAGGED SCHOOLS of the Mission contained every Sunday about\n1,700 children, gathered from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst\ntwo LARGE MISSION HALLS, situated in the midst of the adult population,\nand seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday crowded by the working classes,\nwho throng to hear in them earnest evangelical addresses.  These varied\nreligious and temperance efforts, among adults, as well as the\neducational and refuge work among destitute children, need a\nconsiderable sum of money for their support.\n\nDuring the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions, owing to\nextraordinary expenses in building, were only met by obtaining from the\nbankers an advance of \u00a36,000.  The Committee are now most anxious to\nrepay that sum, and with this object appeal to the benevolently disposed\nfor assistance to remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of\ndebt under which they are labouring for the first time since their\nestablishment in 1867.",
                "-Found at Last: the Veritable Garden of Eden: Or a place that answers the Bible description of the notable spot better than anything yet discovered-\n\n\nOn the principle of \u201cfirst know you are right, then go ahead,\u201d I have been\nvery slow in making public the results of my discovery. But having become\nthoroughly satisfied that I have a reasonable thing of it, have ventured\nto publish it. It has appeared in brief articles in the Galesville\nCHAPTER: INDEPENDENT, in order to invite general inspection, and criticism.\n\nWhen God made man to dwell on the face of the earth, He, evidently, must\nplace him somewhere. In giving the antldiluvians a description of the\ncreation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and\nhow God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts,\nand gave a description of the location\u2014and it not being on that continent,\nhe could not point it out to them\u2014and as the country in which Noah then\nresided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor\nwas any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the\nlocation, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a\nprofound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause\nof no little speculation.  But by degrees it has  been opening to the\nminds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere\non the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly\npointing to what is known as the \u201cNorth West,\u201d as the place. But of this\nlast fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and\ncommenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my\nfamiliarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the\nhanging garden and looking over the plat, and admirirg its most wonderful\nscenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a\nsuggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as\nthe plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never\ngiven it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or\nmight be its proper dimentions. However so strong were my impressions,\nthat I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my\nfriends, This is the garden of Eden.\n\nSince I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while\nsome have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being\nnot only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientest place the\nfirst pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an\ninhabitant of all the earth?  Not too far north, not too far south. Our\ngarden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth,\nas these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and\nshould be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be\nplaced at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of\nthe stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth\nand luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But\nit should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual\ngrowth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great\nBuilder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place\nfor that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its\nsurroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.\n\nI have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have\ndiscovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with\nthe results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory\ninvestigation.\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nOut of Eden to water the garden,\u2014\u2014And from thence,\u2014\u2014it was\nwhich means long river, symbol of greatness and importance, and which,\nanswers to our \u201cFather of Waters.\u201d  It is plain that Eden is a certain\ncountry; that the Euphrates river crosses that country, that \u201ceastward\u201d,\nor on the eastward, bank of, or at a certain point on that river, is\nlocated the garden of Eden; and that three lesser rivers run through and\nwater this garden, flowing into the great river; thus four rivers run into\nand water it, but only one, the fourth, runs out. As to how it was\nwatered, we have a clue; \u201cAnd Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the\ngarden of the Lord;\u201d by streams crossing the plain, and running into the\nriver of Jordon, just as our three rivers cross our garden plain, into our\nEuphrates. The names given to these rivers were, doubtless, explanations\nof facts well known to the antideluvians.\n\nWe need not now undertake to prove, or show what must readily be admitted,\nthat, there is no such spot, or coming together of rivers in the region\nwhere it was first supposed to be, and which has caused explorers and\nresearchers to turn to Africa, and other countries, in search of the\nplace; and Dr. Warren, with all his learning and ingenuity, to the North\nPole. But we have found it where he and others, can come and see for\nthemselves.\n\nIt is located on the \u201ceastward bank\u201d of the Mississippi River, between the\nbeautiful cities of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Winona Minnesota. Please\nnotice the beauty and euphony of those names. The Mississippi\u2014the bible\nEuphrates\u2014river, being one of the longest and most picturesque rivers in\nthe world. Its valley, proper\u2014with its tributaries, some of which reach\nfar out into \u201cHavilah\u201d the \u201cLand of good gold\u201d\u2014extends from the Alleghany\nmountains on the eastern border, 2,000 miles westward to the Rocky\nmountains on the western border, and from the Gulf of Mexico, on the\nsouth, extending 2,000 miles north, across the United States into the\nBridtish possessions. This vast area, Eden,\u2014containing the most fertile\nand habitable region of earth, and is being settled and inhabited by the\nmost industrious, enlightened, christianized and well to-do people in the\nworld; the asylum or universal home of the oppressed and needy of all\nlands,\u2014contains \u201cThe heart of the New World,\u201d the \u201cLand of Promise,\u201d in\nthis Christian United States of America. Central in this domain, Eden, is\nour Garden of Eden. The soil is not a deep, rich paste, like the\nAmerican bottoms opposite St. Louis, on the same river, which is known to\nbe the richest land in the world, but higher, drier, and more habitable,\neasily cultivated, and adapted to gardening.\n\nThe river here, as in most places, has three banks; the first a little\nabove high water mark,\u2014densely covered with forest trees, which consitutes\nthe islands and \u201criver bottoms\u201d\u2014cut up by water courses and sloughs. The\nriver and bottoms are about two miles wide, over and through which the\n\u201cLaughing\u201d and \u201cFather of waters,\u201d courses, run, and play their dances.\n\nThe second bank is high and dry above the hightest water mark,\u2014and\ngenerally smooth prairie, and ready in the state of nature for the garden\nplow\u2014extending back on one or both sides of the river for miles, making a\nvalley at this place, of about ten miles in the widest, when we reach the\nbank, bluff, or rocky wall, which rises\u2014on each side of our garden\u2014to the\naltitude of 600 feet above the river, being the point of the highest\nbluffs on the Mississippi.\n\nNineteen miles above La Crosse, and twelve miles below Winona, on the\n\u201ceastward bank,\u201d nestles, and spreads out that most beautiful town site,\nTrempealeau, on which ought now to be a large city, and which doubtless\nwould have been but for the greed and ignorance of a part of its original\nproprietors, who being told, and thinking they had the \u201cnicest,\u201d \u201cmost\nbeautiful,\u201d \u201csplendid,\u201d town site on the Mississippi river, they were\nbound to get rich at once, \u201cbut not knowing their day,\u201d and how to build\nup a town like, the fabled dog, \u201cthey grabbed for the shadow and lost the\nreality;\u201d \u201cTheir language was confounded and their work delayed.\u201d Here on\nthe second bank, is raised, our \u201cHanging Garden,\u201d a crescent bluff, high\nas the outside wall, extending three miles up the river, terminating at\neach end in a point, and one mile through the center, being in the form of\na new moon, and unlike anything of the kind, so far as known, in the\nentire world, and must be seen to be appreciated.\n\nThis is not one solid smooth topped hill, but possesses all the variety of\nbluff formation, containing groves of forest trees, ravines, slopes,\nscattered rocks, and perpendicular ledges facing the river, like the \u201cFace\nof a King,\u201d some of these ledges are 200 ft. high, commencing more than\nhalf way up the mound, then rising perpendicular to near the very top. The\ntop of this hanging garden has its slopes, mounds, pyramids, domes, and\npinnacles, in most beautiful variety; and at the present time, it is\ndotted with fields of grain, and specked with stone quarries and lime\nkilns. Now, please, place yourself with me on the \u201cCentral Outer Dome\u201d\n\n\u201cHeald\u2019s quarry,\u201d facing toward the eastward, and you have, before, below,\nand around you the veritable Garden of Eden; a valley scene, in extent and\nimportance unequalled in America, and I think, in the world. Not like the\nYosemite, small, romantic grand but uninhabitable or unfit for a\ngarden, but the very beau ideal of a garden.\n\nNow that we are up where we can see, let us look across and around this\ngarden. Turn, now and face the south-west. There, before and below you\nflows the Mississippi, whose name is as euphonious as the Euphrates, or\nits own flowing waters. See its \u201cBroad channels,\u201d queer and picturesque\nislands, its trees and vine-clad bottoms, lovely beyond description; its\ngeneral course, not meandering, but evenly hugging the base of the\nMinnesota bluffs, or western wall of the garden, which it does for some\ntwenty-five miles, or from just below Winona, to just above La Crosse,\nrunning in a southeasterly and southern direction, making a beautiful\ncurve, leaving the main garden valley on the \u201cEastward\u201d bank, in the form\nof a section of an ampitheater, 35 miles long, 5 miles wide at each end,\nand 10 miles through the center. This vast valley plain is our Garden of\nEden. Now, Look! as thousands before you have done in wonder and\nsurprise! Look immediately around you, over the hanging garden on which\nyou stand, and, look out for snakes, for how could you have such a\ngarden without a \u201cSerpent.\u201d, And this hanging garden has been notable and\nnotorious for rattlesnakes, from time immemorial, handed down in their\nIndian name \u201crattlesnake hills,\u201d and including Mount Trempealeau, (a\nseparate and distinct pyramid) was formerly \u201cLiterally alive with\nrattlesnakes.\u201d Mr. Dovile, one of the first white settlers at Trempealeau,\nwho built his shanty on the bank, a few rods from the river, killed, and\nkept count of ninety great rattlesnakes the first season, in, and crossing\nhis foot-path from his house to the river, saying nothing of how many he\nkilled elsewhere.\n\nBut as Christians have taken possession of the hanging garden, the\nserpents have been destroyed, or are disappearing.\n\nThe scenery now around us surpasses my power of adequate description, as\ndo the great lakes. Superior, Michigan, Huron,\u2014and so on down the line,\u2014in\ntheir magnitude and importance, those little lakes in the garden,\nsoutheast of us, containing a few acres each, mirroring their shining\nbeauties into our faces. But O, how beautifully, and magnificently fenced,\nor walled in, is our garden! While there is a general level, bounding the\ntop, yet what an indescribable variety of topping out. Cones, oblongs,\nsmooth ridges, trees, huge rocks, rough, ragged and jageed, in almost\nendless variety.  Perpendicular ledges boldly facing us: or single rocks\nof varied sizes; smooth bald heads, and ridges; deep, and dark chasms;\nwide openings of river\u2019s mouths; all making one of the grandest panoramas\nconceivable.  At present this \u201cwild scenery\u201d is being effaced by the\nprofuse growth of timber.  Near the southern extremity, lies the beautiful\nflourishing city of La Crosse, with its tall church spires and electric\ntowers, fringed with smoke from its numerous lumber mills; most\nappropriately and providentially named. La Crosse\u2014saying nothing of its\nbeing the name of an ancient game modernized\u2014as here crosses the\ngarden one of the four notable rivers, whose opening and bluff outline,\nmay be seen coming in from the \u201cfar east,\u201d making and containing the\nnotable and once far-famed, \u201cLa Crosse valley\u201d; on which is located the\nbeautiful city of Sparta.\n\nJust beyond La Crosse city, and to the left we see the outline entrance of\nMormon Cooley valley, which creek bounds the lower end of our garden. Now\nas we trace the wall to the left,\u2014past the La Crosse valley, and first\neastern gate\u2014we discover another small line of opening through which runs\nHalf-way creek, notable as the home (Holman) of Norwegians. The next bold\nheavy prominence is \u201cKing bluff.\u201d Still tracing on, we notice some queer\nlooking rocks, lying on top of a ridge; then, the Twin points, the outer\none the \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d a most beatiful cone mound pointed with rock, and\nbeckon to Black river valley, this side of which, is \u201cCastle rock;\u201d and to\nthe left, a wide opening and a beautiful valley,\u2014the central and main\neastern gate\u2014with branching valleys, extending east and northeast, all in\nfront of you, down which flows the notable \u201cBlack river,\u201d appropriately\nnamed, from the natural blackness of its waters, and because it cuts and\ndivides our garden through its center, and making a beautiful belt of\ntimbered bottoms. As it nears the Mississippi, it forms a delta, one part\nturning to the left, and running parallel to the Mississippi, forming that\ngrand booming pond, and depot of lumbering at Onalaska; and then empties\nitself into the Mississippi at LaCrosse; thus inclosing, and forming\nFrench island, once the resort of counterfeiters.\n\nAs you glance up Black River valley, coming in from the right, is\n\u201cFlemming\u2019s creek,\u201d or Lewis\u2019 valley, a fertile valley, in which is\nlocated the euphonious Mendora; those blue highlands, apparently at the\nhead of the main valley is \u201cRobinson\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cPine Hill,\u201d between Black\nRiver Falls and Sparta. This way to the left, that beautiful notch in the\nbluff is \u201cPeacock Pass,\u201d and is just this side of North Bend, and though\napparently so near, is some \u201ctwenty miles away.\u201d  This heavy point, at the\nleft of Black river, is \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d the next best point from which\nto view this valley garden.  To the left and farther away, look at that\ngreat rock, big as a barn, topping out another cone. That is the\nveritable \u201cDecora\u2019s Peak,\u201d named after that wonderful one-eyed chieftain,\nwho, with a few  of his brave and loyal band, lodged, occasionally in a\ncave in that rock; and from its hight were enable to discover any game, or\neven an enemy within a large range. Once on a time, it is said, he\ndiscovered the prowling \u201cBlack Hawk,\u201d with his band of warriors, and ran\nto Prairie du Chien, ninety miles in one day, to inform the U. S.\n\nGovernment; and, then, helped to capture their enemy.  A little farther to\nthe left, and just across the garden from us wedged in a narrow opening,\nlies the village of Galesville, on Beaver creek,\u2014a branch of Black\nriver,\u2014with its exquisitely beautiful lake, and bounding fish, its fine\nwater power, health giving mineral springs, Galesville University and\nchoice people.  \u201cBeautiful for situation\u201d is Galesville, the joy of all\nits inhabitants, if not of all the earth.  And \u201cas the hills are round\nabout Jerusalem,\u201d so are the hills, and vastly more magnificent ones,\nround about Galesville, and the scenery simply GRAND. Looking up Beaver\ncreek valley, to the left, is Maughmer\u2019s bluff which affords a grand view;\nand still to the left, that dim mountain peak, pointed with rock and\nshrubs (in the direction of Blair, in Trempealeau valley,) is \u201cChapel\nPeak.\u201d  In the early settlement, by whites, of this region of country, two\nMethodist itinerants, A. B. Smith and Isaac Springer were  following a dim\nwagon track, on their way to Galesville, which track passed along at the\nbase of that peak; and they clambered to its top, and found there \u201cThe\nrock-formed pulpit\u201d or altar, which had stood there for ages, into which\nthey entered, and as they were both good singers, they sang,\u2014to make the\nwelkins ring, as there was nothing else thereto hear:\u2014\nOn the mountain-top appearing,\nLo! The sacred Herald stands,\nWelcome news in Zion bearing\nZion long in hostile lands.\n\nStill tracing the garden wall as we turn to the left, we face the \u201cBig\nTamarac\u201d through an opening in the wall, a swamp of dense tamarac, one\nmile wide, and six miles long, bordered with belts and groves of oak,\nfurnishing fencing and fuel for the upper end of the garden. Another turn\nand you are looking through \u201cWhistler\u2019s Pass,\u201d another of \u201cNature\u2019s\nhighways\u201d out of the garden; this leading through the Polander settlement\ninto the Trempealeau Valley. Another turn and we mark the bluff outline\nand entrance into the garden\u2014the third and last eastern gate,\u2014of the\nTrempealeau river, crossing it at the upper end; and like Black river, it\nforms a delta, one part running down along side of the Mississippi,\nforming an island, on the lower end of which, is that wonderful \u201cMount\nTrempealeau,\u201d a rocky cone covered with pine trees, where with the outlet\nof Trempealeau lake, it flows through a narrow opening between the\nmountain and crescent hanging garden\u2014of which it forms a part\u2014into the\nMississippi river. Trempealeau Lake, at the head of the hanging garden,\njust back of the mountain, is a body, principally of spring water, and is\none of the most notable fishing ponds known, attracting fishermen from far\nand near. \u201cTrempealeau; surrounded, soaked, fertilized with water.\u201d So\nexpressive, so important to this region is the word, that the lake, the\nisland, the mountain, the river, the county; the township, and the village\nare all named Trempealeau.\n\nAnother slight turn and we are looking into the closed up valley of the\nMississippi,\u2014on account of a bend in the river\u2014which is the fourth and\nlast river that enters, crosses, and waters this garden is on the west\nbank of which, at the upper end of our garden, right there, plainly before\nyou, lies the charming bustling city of Winona,\u2014associated with a thousand\nlegends of Indian traditions,\u2014with its tall water tower, its numerous\nlumber mills, churches, normal school, and enterprising people, stretching\nitself over a smooth and most lovely prairie. Vandal proprietors are\ndevouring their \u201cSugar Loaf,\u201d standing just back of the city, as well as\nquarrying down their native garden walls.\n\nIn our constant turning to the left, that string of white buildings below\nWinona, on the river\u2019s bank and pressed against the foot of the wall, is\nHomer, a quiet little ville.\n\nIn our western view we shall not see so many objects of interest; as not a\nriver pierces the western wall, only a few little brooks, or trout\nharboring runs,\u2014where they used to catch the speckled trout by the bushel,\nprominent among which is Cedar run, just, a little above us and Trout run\ndirectly opposite of us, on which is located the celebrated \u201cPick Wick\u201d\nflouring mills\u2014are all that indent or mar its smooth and even face. Then,\neverything appears to be so near by. The forms, and farm houses, in such\nmultiplied variety, so plain in sight, just \u201cOver there,\u201d outside of the\ngarden, rough and rugged, to where \u201cFallen Humanity\u201d was driven. And we\nare getting tired of looking, so we make a rapid turn, glancing along the\nwall down over New Amsterdam and Holland settlement, to the point of\ncommencement, and are looking into the closed-up valley, on account of\nanother bend, in this mighty, mighty, Mississippi river, in its exit out\nof this Garden of Eden.\n\nAs we look down once more on this valley garden land, with its little\nsilver lakes, and shining streams, beautiful groves and undulating\nprairies, and try to peer into its future, we are completely overwhelmed\nwith emotion, as we notice it is just beginning to be checkered up, by\nmarks of intelligent human occupancy, as well as by the Indian tepee and\nwigwam. But the time of gardening is not yet. And here is room for\nhundreds of thousands of the fallen sons of God, to come and regain a home\nin this \u201cParadise on earth\u201d to all such as have a Paradise within them.\n\nNow, will any one believe us? \u201cCome and see!\u201d Dr. Warner and all. Take\nthis description in your hand, read, and look, and like the \u201cQueen of\nSheba,\u201d you will lose your \u201cspirit of doubting,\u201d and say: \u201cIt was a true\nreport, though I believed it not, but now that mine eyes have seen it, the\none half of its greatness was not told.\u201d\n\nThe scenery just outlined, is amazingly grand,\nThe work of the Deity, worthy his hand.\n\nFrom our past observation, it is not so very strange to us, that\nindividuals often pass along over important sections of earth with out\nnoticing its beauty and its glory. Not that its flowers and its fruits are\naltogether hidden, but that they have become common place, or for lack of\nattention, on account of preoccupancy of the mind, are not noticed. Nor is\nit much wonder that individuals should reside right in the midst of the\ngarden of Eden and not be aware of it; see many of its peculiar\ncharacteristics, and yet not recognize them; simply because they seem\nnatural; were indeed natural; just as God made it; or, the results of\nnatural growth and changes. It is perfectly plain from the Bible account,\nand that is our guide in this matter, that Eden was a country, and that\na very important river crossed or ran through and watered that country,\nand because of its importance was named Euphrates.\u2014the great river, a very\ncommon ancient method of naming things.\u2014And that, \u201cEastward,\u201d or on the\neastward bank of that river, central in this Eden, at a certain\npoint,\u2014where three rivers joined the great river, the four entering, and\ncrossing the garden, and only the great river running out of it,\u2014was\nlocated the garden of Eden; One of the most desirable places for a human\nbeing to dwell. Conducive of human happiness: First, where there was a\nplenty of good water, for human uses, and to fertilize the land, also\nfor fishes and fowls, and yet exempt from malarial diseases. And we ask,\nwhere can there be found another plat of earth, of the same size and\nsurroundings, so abundantly watered, and with all the requisites for a\ngarden, and yet so free from malaria, as is our garden of Eden.  Second,\nfar enough north to catch the dry, balmy, health inspiring atmosphere, and\nthe pure water, the native home of the speckled trout, and yet the summer\ntemperature of the mild temperate zone, a medium from which to send its\ninhabitants north and south. Third, exemption from the great terrors of\nmankind, earthquake and cyclone. While the mountains are far away \u201cround\nabout\u201d our Eden, and the minerals in great abundance and variety are\nwithin and about it, yet so far removed are they from the garden, as\nentirely to exempt it from earthquakes; as these are confined to sea\ncoasts, and gas producing regions.  And as cyclones are supposed to be\nproduced by the sun\u2019s rays,\u2014as they never occur in the night,\u2014and peculiar\nelectric concentration, which requires uniformity of land, or region, and\nheat, and as our garden is sunk down into the earth to the depth of 500\nfeet, and in a line or direction, requiring a cyclone to cross it at right\nangles,\u2014as their course is from the south of west, toward the north of\neast\u2014and thus would have to leap the chasm, or loose its force in tumbling\ninto it,\u2014and such is the uneveness of the country around it as to lessen\nliability\u2014for a cyclone is simply an electric wind storm, and not a\nthunder storm, and moves in a single cloud, and not spread abroad, and\nwould be broken by an uneven country; find also on account of the\nevaporation arising from the \u201cmuch water\u201d of our garden, such an electric\nheated current could not well be formed across it; so we are naturally\nexempt from cyclone, as well as earthquakes, which must be a great relief\nof mind, and source of enjoyment to our residents. Yet from its size, and\nshallowness, we must still be subject to high and purifying winds, and\nrain storms. And as evaporation and consequently the conducting of\nelectricity from the earth to the cloud regions, must go on more rapidly\nin our garden, on a hot day, because of its \u201cmuch water,\u201d so, doubtless,\nwe shall always have our full quota of thunder storms. The rains, however,\nbeing generally, of the more steady and general character.\n\nTo the language of Bishop Foss in his article on Minnesota, just published\nin the Christian Advocate:\u201cFrom my vantage ground of observation, near\nthe center of the continent, I greet you and many of your readers on its\ndistant rim;\u201d we just wish to add, that our garden of Eden is bounded on\nthe west by southern Minnesota, therefore central. Again, \u201cMy point of\nobservation is lofty as well as central. Minnesota occupies the most\nelevated plateau between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and forms the\nwatershed of three great river systems of the central part of North\nAmerica\u2014the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and the Red River of the\nNorth\u2014its average elevation being just about 1,000 feet, the highest point\n1,600 feet.\u201d Again, \u201cConcerning the climate, I condense the statement of\nthe Encylopedia Britanica: Its elevation above sea-level gives an\nagreeable rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs\nand damp weather unknown. The comparative dryness of the atmosphere\nneutralizes the severest effect of excessive cold. The Smithsonian Chart\nassigns to Minnesota an average temperature for the hottest week in summer\nof from 85\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 and for the coldest week in winter from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0\nbelow zero. The average annual rainfall is about 25\u00bd inches. It is evident\nthat the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as felt,\nthe highest degree.\u201d What is thus true of Minnesota, is pre-eminently so\nof our Garden.\n\nWhile there is in our garden nearly every grade of soil, from the sand\nblow-out, to the richest black muck, yet it is principally sandy loam,\njust the foundation, for a garden. Still it produces fairly all kinds of\ngrain.\n\nIn our early settlement, over thirty years ago, Deacon Gilbert, raised,\nnear Galesville, fifty-two bushels of wheat to the acre; and it was\nreported of some one raising 60. On a farm, located midway between the\nhanging garden and the opposite wall, purchased by D. O. VanSlyke from the\ngovernment\u2014as \u201cHopkins choice,\u201d or the refuse vacant land, and last to be\nentered on the prairie, or entire upper end of the garden,\u2014when, at its\nbest, produced forty bushels of wheat to the acre. And as one forty was\ndevoted to wheat, several crops were taken, averaging over 35 bushels to\nthe acre; then gradually decreasing to the fifteenth crop, one having been\nof corn, and fourteen of wheat, without the application of any fertilizers\nwhatever, when it produced only 18 bushels of No. 1 wheat to the acre.\n\nThese facts came within my own observation, and are probably, above the\naverage of the entire garden; as the assessors assessed this farm, for a\nnumber of years at nineteen dollars per acre, when it was offered for sale\nat fifteen dollars per acre. But Trempealeau Prairie has been notable for\nmany years as the \u201cEgypt\u201d for corn producing. And we have no way of\nestimating what could be done in the line of gardening, for lack of a\nmarket, or capitalists to successfully enter competition. But as to the\napple-tree, that appears to have been driven out with fallen man; and\nwhether redeemed man can restore it, is a question, as it is not designed\nat present, for man to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth.\n\nOf the scenery we have never tired. It is always fresh and enchanting. And\nsuch an inspiring feeling, of \u201cthis is my home!\u201d \u201cO what a delightful\nhome!\u201d\n\nIf any, who pass along at the base of Chappel Peak, on a clear day will\ntake the foot path and ascend it to its top, its altitude probably not 200\nfeet above them, they will have within easy range of the eye such a\nlandscape scene, as but few upon earth ever have the privilege of looking;\nand one that will greatly enthuse an admirer of nature. And they will be\napt to feel as well as to see the appropriateness of its name. If they can\nsing, or preach, they will want to join with those preachers, and sing, or\npreach to an assembled world, seated within the incircling walls.\n\nIf you are at Galesville, ask some one to point out \u201cHeuston\u2019s Bluff,\u201d you\nneed no guide, only good walking muscles, pick your way, and tug on until\nyou reach the top. Then, after taking a general look all around you, sit\ndown and rest you. Now, take another general sweeping birds-eye view, all\naround, seeing everything in the aggregate; then rest awhile, and\ncontemplate it.\n\nNow you are, or ought to be, prepared to itemize, or to look attentively\nat particular objects; and if you have our description, it will greatly\nassist, as well as interest you. We believe that no grander garden valley\nscene exists on this beautiful earth. Therefore patiently wait, don\u2019t\ncease your viewing, or think of leaving the place in less than two hours;\nor until you fully realize the \u201cinspiration\u201d of this masterly scene; and\nwe have no fears, if you are anything of an admirer of the magnificent in\nnature, but that you will thank us a thousand times for calling your\nattention to it.\n\nThat heavy bold front in the garden wall beyond the mouth of Black River\nis \u201cKing bluff\u201d which is now easily distinguished as the central highest\npoint in the eastern wall, and which is just opposite of \u201cQueen bluff,\u201d\nthe central highest point in the western wall of our garden, and said to\nbe the highest land on the Mississippi river. Here, from Heuston\u2019s bluff,\nwe have a better view of Black river, and its tributaries, than from our\nformer place of observation.  Now we stand as it were right over them, and\ncan see to the \u201cNorthward and Eastward.\u201d \u201cAlps on Alps arise;\u201d Decora\u2019s\nPeak and Mound so plainly and beautifully near; then those most beautiful\ncone mountains, and Chapel Peak, up Beaver creek, points for beacon\nlights, and charmingly beautiful scenes looming up most conspicuously.  We\ndo say that you can find many grand valley and landscape scenes on the\nMississippi, and its tributaries, and we do not wonder that good writers\nextol them,\u2014should wonder if they did not,\u2014but we further say that we have\nthe Garden; and everything considered, not only the greatest, and\ngrandest, and best, but the only spot on earth that answers the Bible\ndescription of that notable spot, or Garden of Eden.\n\nMoritz Engel of Dresden-Newstadt, Germany, has written a book, an octavo\nof 207 pages, dated Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s day, December 1884, entitled: \u201cThe\nSolution of the Paradise Question.\u201d To a review of this book, President W.\n\nJ. Warren of the Boston University, has devoted over a column in the\nChristian Advocate of Aug. 20, 1885. Engel claims to demolish, and\ndoubtless does, the preceding \u201ceighty nugatory attempts at a solution.\u201d\n\nAnd as anyone can see, Dr. Warren demolishes Engel\u2019s attempt to foist his\nriverless \u201cTartarian swale in the heart of the North Syrian desert,\u201d as\nthe veritable Eden; in the lower end of which was his Garden, alternating\nbetween a pool or lake, caused by the rains, and filled by the torrents\nduring the rainy season, and a dried up, parched, barren spot, drying up,\n\u201ctowards the end of May, or first of June; without a green thing,\u201d\u2014utterly\nuninhabitable,\u2014and which Engel admits, \u201chas always been so.\u201d\n\nThe chief value of Engel\u2019s production, as well as Dr. Warren\u2019s North Pole\nGarden, is to show, (in Dr. Warren\u2019s own language.) \u201cThe imperishable\ninterest of the Eden problem;\u201d and to leave the subject entirely clear for\nme, and a calm consideration of the facts of the case as we find them. Dr.\nWarren, naturally, (as anyone who undertakes to do a thing and fails,)\nscouts the idea of anyone else doing it, or of a litteral four rivered;\nGarden of Eden. So have others who have failed to find it.\n\nEngel puts in a claim of Divine inspiration directing him to the spot; and\nhe writes with the positiveness and unreasonableness of a crank. All the\ninspiration we claim, is the beauty and grandeur of the scenery, and the\nadaptation and facsimile, or actual description of the spot, to the\ndescription given in the Bible, a Divinely inspired book, as our guide to\nit.\n\nWe are aware that we are living in an age of scientific speculation, of\ncounterfeits, and humbugs. After misguided explorers have given up the\nsearch, in the Eastern Continent, a scientest, to show his skill, must\nthrow a cloud on the possibility of finding a literal \u201cfour rivered spot,\u201d\non earth, and gives us an ingenious unaproachable North Pole Garden. A\ncrank gives us a volcanic \u201cTartarian,\u201d riverless desert as the spot,\nunder a profession of Divine inspiration, A land speculator, must dress up\na Florida malarial swamp as the place, to entice purchasers to his lands.\n\nNow, providentially, we are clear of all these objections. We do not have\nan unapproachable, frozen sea; or Tartarian volcanic region;  or malarial\nswamp; or government, or company, lands to sell. Our Garden is principally\nowned by actual settlers. All the land I own, is a burial lot in the\nGalesville cemetery, and not for sale; and not many have money enough to\npurchase it.\n\nBut we have an Eden that challenges your attention; and a Garden that\nwill awaken your admiration.  Come and see! Please notice the natural\nyouuthfulness of the region immediately around our Garden. Take about a\nhundred miles square,\u2014of which our Garden is the centre,\u2014and you will have\nsome of the most charming mountain and valley scenery in the world, minus\nthe mountains, or all in miniature, just such hills and valleys in which\nthe youth most delight. A more appropriate region to surround the Garden\nwe cannot conceive.  While immediately outside of this region you enter\nupon a broad level country, principally prairie, of rich farming lands,\nindicating the next step in developed humanity, and the very beau ideal of\nan Eden; and as you go outward, the earth abounds in minerals, and in\nunlimited sources of wealth. Take a map of Palestine giving a birds-eye\nview of the hills and valleys, of which Jerusalem is somewhat central, and\nyou will have a fair representation or view of the region around our\nGarden, and see the force of the expression, \u201cas the hills are round about\nJerusalem, so is the Lord round about his people,\u201d and so are the hills\nround about our Garden.\n\nDid you say as you looked down over our Garden valley, that this is too\nlarge a plat of ground for the Garden of Eden? Bless you! have you not\nconsidered that the Garden should be proportionate to the Land of Eden?\n\nWhy, did you think that the Garden of Eden was only a half-acre garden\npatch, or small orchard? Read again your Bible on that subject. How could\nyou get four rivers into it then, to water it, and one of them a\n\u201cEuphrates\u201d a wonderful great river? And is not the usual idea of a\ngarden, a beautiful rich flat, or valley, like Lot\u2019s plain of Jordan?\n\nPlease just think again, how God had created the whole earth for the\nhabitation of the human family, and would he stint the allotment of the\nfirst pair? Did you think how long they lived, how many children they\nprobably had, what a numerous family before the first pair died, numbering\ninto the ten thousands? Did you ever give thought to the plan of\nsettlement, of these children? Of the necessity of water thoroughfares,\nand the wisdom of God in locating them in some grand centre, as is this\ngarden, in this central, wonderful water-shed in this Eden as already\nshown, comprising the great centre of this continent; and that when this\ngarden should be well filled with inhabitants, by means of boats, and easy\nwater conveyance, they could easily branch out and make settlements along\nthe rivers? Can you grasp the mightiness of Jehovah\u2019s plan, in locating\nthe first pair at the junction of so many rivers into one so great a\nriver, and central to this Eden; thus naturally and easily to extend the\nsettlements over so vast a region of excellent country, as this Eden\u2014the\ngreatest half of a continent,\u2014and all this before the invention of wagon\nroads and railroads. Please give it wise thought, before deciding it so\nquickly.\n\nDid you pugh! pugh! at the idea of the garden, and antdieluvian\nsettlements, being so far away from Mt. Ararat? An ingenious Yankee, F. H.\n\nKribs, has figured that out long ago; that the ark would naturally go\neastward, and would just about reach that mountain in the time it was\nfloating; and that the current ran eastward is proven by the eastward\ndirection of submerged antediluvian trees. Then, how natural that God\nshould remove the redeemed ones far away from the scenes and remembrances\nof human corruption and abominations before the flood; and let him develop\n\u201cup anew,\u201d in the midst of new scenes and surroundings, and, as it were,\nin a \u201cnew world,\u201d until the sufficient development of his being, to allow,\nby slow stages, to return him to the place of commencement. Did you ask\nwhat mean these mounds, or earthly representations of such a variety of\nliving objects, so plentiful in and around this garden, and scattered\nthroughout the country of Eden, on one of which we are now standing? There\nwas science and durability in their construction. Did he say they were\nbuilt by the mound-builders? Evidently; but who are the mound-builders?\n\nThat is not in history or tradition. The first who came here after the\nflood, found the mounds here, and asked the question: who are the\nmound-builders? The mound-builders were silent. And every new comer and\nevery generation have asked that question, but no one could answer.\n\nNaturally enough, \u201cThere was not one left to tell the tale.\u201d They had\nunwisely, and laboriously used their time, strength, and ingenuity, for\nunworthy objects and purposes, and not for the comfort, education, and\nmoral development of humanity. They had added to their folly wickedness;\n\u201cthey had changed the truth of God into a lie;\u201d had \u201cserved and worshiped\nthe creature, (and dirt images) and not their Creator;\u201d and God had\nblotted them out, while some of their earthworks remain.\n\nDid a lawyer from this place, make a point in his plea before court at\nWhitehall, by declaring that I must be mistaken in my locality of the\nGarden of Eden, for lack of the presence of a personal devil? In retort, I\nam compelled to say, that I was sent a missioniary to this region, over\nthirty years ago, and that I found the devil, or his tools, then\npredominating in the M. E. society here; and when we tried to \u201cturn the\nrascals out,\u201d we found that he, or they, outnumbered us in influence and\nfacilities, and turned the scale against us; and we have abundant facts to\nshow that he has held his grip in that society \u201cunto this day.\u201d\n\nDid that Witty Editor say that we could prove our proposition by Josh\nBillings\u2019 method; viz.: \u201cthat no one could prove that it was not the\nGarden of Eden?\u201d Very good. But we can do better. We can and have proved\nit, on scientific principles. We give a law: \u201cAn hypothesis that explains\nall the phenomena, and contradicts every opposing hypothesis, is\nconsidered proof.\u201d Now, our hypothesis, and exact description of the plat,\nexplains the phenomena, answers perfectly the requirements; and, as it is\nadmitted that no other known plat on earth does so, we claim the proof,\nand shall hold the ground until driven from it by a more successful\ndiscoverer. And we do not fear Dr. Warren as competitor, though he has\nalso written a book; as he must first go, or get some one to go to the\nNorth pole and survey his garden before he can bring in his proof, (and\nthat, doubtless, will let us out during the present generation) and\nwithout which proof we will laugh down his theory, and his book, the\neditor of the Christian Advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWe have necessarily, given a very condensed statement, and discription, to\nmeet, developed modern, as well as original modes of thinking, and to give\nthe less developed ones an opportunity to study.\n\nIn giving the description of the Garden of Eden, does the Bible, there, or\nanywhere, say so, or is there any grounds to believe, or suppose that it\nwas written or printed in legible imperishable characters, on the walls\naround, on the sky above, or on conspicuous places within the garden,\n\u201cThis is the Garden of Eden?\u201d If not, what is our guide? Evidently not a\nLo here, or a Lo there, but the plain description, fairly interpreted, and\nthe place that answers that description; and we have it. Now, the public\npress of La Crosse, and Winona, within the borders of our garden and who\nmight be supposed to know the merit, or demerit of my claim, have not\ndeigned to notice my articles on the Garden of Eden; so they cannot be\naccused of conspiring with me to mislead the public, to attract to their\ncities; or of having any faith in my discovery; and yet, I challenge any\nof them to show any material incorrectness of my description and\nstatements.\n\nOnce, when on a steamboat, coming up the Mississippi, through our garden,\nand standing forward, on the upper deck, near a well dressed gentleman,\nwho was intently looking at and admiring scenery which had also attracted\nmy attention, he turned suddenly, and excitedly said, \u201cSee! (pointing) O\nsee, that most enchantingly lovely scene, there!\u201d (as if he had never\nbefore seen its equal.) \u201cThere, if an artist should paint that, they would\nsay, \u2018That is purely imaginary; the result of fancy\u2019; but there is the\nfoundation and excitement to his art; and no known artist can measure up\nto the reality.\u201d Perhaps neither of us will ever again see so enraptureing\na scene of clouds, shades, lights and shadows, of bluff scenery,\u2014and that\nmeans something here\u2014of beautiful islands and forest trees, as was just\nthen around us, and mirrored to us in that grand old looking-glass, on\nwhose placid waters we were then floating. Being of like sympathy, I\nentered into conversation with him, when he kindly informed me, that, to\ngratify his passion for scenery, he had traveled extensively in the old\nworld, or foreign countries, that he was now taking in the Mississippi\nRiver, and that this was the most beautiful and attractive river scenery\nhe had ever seen in his life; and that it far surpassed anything they had\nseen in the old world. I have had several similar statements of noted\ntravelers, enough, with what I have seen myself, to satisfy me of the\ntruthfulness of my claim. I have taken several acknowledged eminent\ntravelers to my first point of observation, (Healds Bluff) who invariably,\nlike myself, evidently, labored, and failed for language adequately to\nexpress the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of this valley scene. Now, if\nours is not the veritable original Garden of Eden, it is certainly easy of\naccess, of increasing reputation and importance as a summer resort, and\nopen to investigation, and we challenge the strictest inspection. Come and\nsee! Come and see!\n\nI am glad to learn from the Editor of the Independent that I am not the\nfirst one who has \u201clocated the old Bible ground in the Northwest;\u201d would\nlike very much to see the volume alluded to, \u201cwritten fifty years ago,\u201d\ntreating that subject.  Perhaps we might gain some information from one\nwho had given it close intelligent thought, as well as some very desirable\ninformation on this somewhat mysterious subject. Mine was an entire new\nthought to me, suggested by the actual sight, viewing the garden from a\npoint on the hanging garden, and studying it over and over during my\nresidence here of over thirty years.  And despite of my natural\nskepticism, I have become so impressed with the striking resemblance or\nexact likeness of this, to the Bible garden, as therein, described, and\nthe immediate surroundings of this, to Palestine, (the type of the\nsurrounding or original habitation of man) as to force me to admit the\npossibility, and to write out my convictions for the benefit of some one\nbetter informed, and to enable such a one to draw better conclusions.\n\nWhen God formed the earth into a globe, and set it rolling to keep it so,\nand started it in its orbit around the sun, and the light of the sun first\nflashed upon it, producing the requisite light and motion, for marking\ntime, then, with half in light and half in shade, as round the sun earth\ntook its flight, time on earth began. The day, the month, the year.\n\nChronological time commenced on the first day at high 12, and \u201cThe evening\nand the morning  was the first day.\u201d And as man was the only\nintelligent being placed on earth, capable of noting time, his residence\nwas, evidently, on that central line. Our \u201clong\u201d river and garden of Eden,\nis exactly there, on the 90th meridian of central time, as laid down on\nour present time table maps for this continent.\n\nAs everything in creation was full and perfect, God wisely placed the\nearth in the summer solstice point of its orbit, and this continent facing\nthe sun, so that when he placed man upon it, as to give him the benefit of\nharvest, and correct time, and all of which is proved by the change, God\nordered, from original reckoning of time, when Israel left Egypt, Ex. 12,\n2, \u201cThis month  shall be unto you the beginning of\nmonths, it shall be the first month of the year to you.\u201d Thus changing the\nbeginning of the year from mid-summer to mid-winter. The commencing of the\nreckoning of the day has also been changed from mid-day to midnight. That\nthe original first month, now the 7th month, was harvest time, is proved\nfrom Lev. 23, 9-39; and that the seasons, of summer and winter, were then\nas now, is also proven by Gen. 1, 14, and the history of the clothing of\nthe first pair, first aprons, then skins and furs.\n\nThe names given to the rivers and places, in connection with the original\nhabitation of man, were naturally washed out by the flood, or their\nrecollection continued in names of similar places on the new continent.\n\nThen, is it not somewhat remarkable that, our garden valley is in the form\nof a beautiful dove, or bird of paradise; and so grandly walled in as to\nappear as a single valley, and have a hanging garden so situated that from\nits height, the whole valley, the rivers, and \u201cmuch water\u201d all in plain\nsight.\n\nIs it not a little strange that the Holy Land should be the counterpart of\nthe regions around our garden, only ours, geologically, a little older,\nand at present, at least, vastly superior in productiveness and\ndesirability as a home; and that so many things, in connection with and in\naddition to, the exact Bible description of the garden of Eden, and of the\nHoly Land, point to this place as the original garden; oldest, and best\nadapted place on earth for the commencement of human existence, and from\nwhich naturally to branch out, filling the Palestine around it; then, over\nthe entire Eden as already described. Let me once more call your attention\nto the region immediately around our garden, of a section of which we have\nsuch a good view from this Heuston\u2019s Muff, of beautiful hills and valleys,\nsimilar in appearance and extent, to the land of Palestine; which was\nselected by the Creator as a representation of the habitation of man on\nearth, in its pristine glory; a beau ideal of a country, a paradise; a\nregion of supreme felicity and delight; \u201cA land flowing with milk and\nhoney;\u201d which means susceptibility of the highest earthly enjoyments, and\nfigure of the world to come. Such a rough, youthful country, is not\nnaturally subject to cyclones, and disastrous storms, \u201cbut of rains,\u201d and\n\u201cgreen pastures;\u201d not a land of malaria, but a land of health and\nhappiness. Palestine was central to the habitable part of the eastern\ncontinent, and was thus, in connection wilh its other good qualities,\nselected for the residence of God\u2019s chosen people, and contained many of\nthe mountains on which God appeared to man, a very interesting chapter in\nthe history of that country. Then, the central location of Jerusalem, \u201cthe\ncity of the great King;\u201d \u201cBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole\nearth, is Mount Zion;\u201d in which was built the Holy Temple\u2014of which God\nhimself was architect\u2014with its Holy of Holies, where God met the High\npriest, and kept up, though somewhat broken, yet, for long periods,\nspecial communication with man, thus making it a holy and God honored\nspot. There the Jews used to point to a stone, set as they claimed, by\nsome miraculous power, in the precise centre of the world. But whether\nthis was so or not, the city was for a long time the centre of attraction\nof the world\u2019s commerce, and of the best form of religion.\n\n\u201cA land flowing with milk and honey.\u201d Yes, and that we have the place we\nhope to make appear by a few extracts from a speech delivered by T. D.\n\nLewis, before the Wisconsin Dairymen\u2019s Association, at Arcadia,\nTrempealeau County, Wisconsin, February, 1885, published by the Dairymen\u2019s\nAssociation. Mr. Lewis, not knowing of our garden and Palestine, spoke\nonly in reference to what is beginning to be recognized, and well known\nfacts in relation to the dairying interests of this region. Commencing on\npage 76: \u201cAs good, natural grasses and plenty of the right kind of water\nare the material requisites necessary to successful dairying or\nstock-growing generally, I propose to discuss in a brief manner, and for\nthe first time, call the attention of the public to the peculiar quality\nof the soil in this section, and its adaptability for successful grass\ngrowing, especially clover, and of its action, through the grasses and\nbelieve, generally conceded by all stock growers that there is no known\nplant grown that requires so small an outlay of labor and expense\ngenerally, and furnishes so great an amount of plant food of just the\nright kind for producing the best butter, cheese, and good, quickly\nfattened beef, as clover, where it can be grown with anything near\neight or ten years ago, by noticing spots along the roads where clover had\nsprung up in small patches, in soil either wild, or but, at the most,\npartially subdued. I observed that it grew in the most luxuriant manner,\nand spread rapidly, did not winter kill; in fact, looked just as if it had\ncome to stay. I then began a thorough examination of the soil that I have\nnot yet entirely completed, but have ascertained enough to warrant me in\nsaying, that through the agency of the decomposition of an ancient stratum\nof rock, of which the most of our argillaceous clays are composed in this\nvicinity, I find we have a soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of\ncreamery butter took the first, and the Alma creamery the second premium\nat the fair held at St. Louis last fall?  This was from butter made in\nArcadia the second, and in Alma the first season of their opperation. You\ncould not believe, for a moment, that the butter makers employed in these\ntwo creameries were so much better than all the others that exhibited\nbutter at that time, that this was the cause of obtaining the premiums? I\nfind, also, that the Arcadia butter, when placed upon the Elgin market of\nIllinois, is considered superior to the other butter, in all the qualities\nthat go to make up a first-class article, and that is the largest butter\nmarket, outside of Chicago, in the state. You would most certainly assign\nthis cause to other and more correct reasons, and, by an investigation\ninto the facts, would find it was produced through the effects of this\npeculiar chemical material, in its action through the grasses and water of\nhis government survey of this state and Minnesota, will see a small area,\ncolored and marked metamorphic shades. It is no great extent of territory,\nincludes this and Buffalo county, and a portion of Jackson, and about us\nmuch in Minnesota. It has been badly cut up through the agencies of\nerosion, corrosion, and denudation, and probably one-fourth of this area\nis now composed of arenaceious valleys, practically inexhaustible.\u201d Clover\nfields, \u201cflowing with milk and honey,\u201d how appropriate. A Wisconsin\nDairyman took the first premium on butter at the Worlds fair, at\nPhiledelphia, in 1876; at the World\u2019s Exposition at New Orleans, in 1880,\nin dairy products, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota stands at the head; and\nthe head centre of which, when once developed, is our palestine. In cheese\nproducts, at New Orleans, out of 84 premiums, Wisconsin took 71, amounting\nto $2,838. On butter, out of 69 premiums, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin\ntook 54, amounting to $3,364, thus leading the world.\n\nThus who can predict the future greatness of our garden, and the region\naround it; naturally exempt from cyclone\u2014which is beginning to be one of\nthe great terrors of man-kind\u2014as it would require a miracle to leap a\ncyclone from the top of our southwestern wall, down 600 feet, on to the\nbroad Mississippi river\u2014and into a decidedly different atmosphere, the\nreason already given\u2014and keep a whirling. Thirty years of observation has\ntaught me, that small, single storms pass around us, and larger ones,\noften, divide, and, no matter how portentous they look, as  did the one\nthe other day\u2014since the St Cloud cyclone\u2014which, at first sight,\napproaching from the southwest, at the right time of day, and frightful\nblue black color, made the timid ones tremble: but on approaching the\ngarden, it naturally divided, and passed around us, as usual; thus\nconfirming our statement.\n\nNot being a believer in the speculative vague theories of modern\ngeologists, I shall leave the discussion of the geological age of our\ngarden to those wiseacres. But simply notice, that according to standard\nauthorities, our hanging garden contains the veritable Potsdam sand stone\nof the primordial age. And my stone door step, taken from another strata,\nis a mass of Molusk shells of the tribe of Brachiopods\u2014specimens of the\nearliest life on earth\u2014the shells \u201cless in size than a finger nail;\u201d (see\nDana\u2019s geology page 81) related to the modern Lingula; thus composing a\nLingula flag, or Lingula sandstone, of which mine is a slab over 5 feet\nlong, 2 feet wide and six inches thick, the finest specimen I have ever\nseen, and lies at my front door, free for inspection.\n\nThus, on the oldest continent, with an overwhelmingly rich, great, grand\nEden; watered by the \u201cUphrates,\u201d (long river) which, in itself, is\nsuperlative; and which, with its tributaries, waters a superlatively grand\nportion of the earth; and with its central garden, and surpassingly grand\nhanging gardens, which overtop, and as immeasurably transcend the hanging\ngardens of Babylon\u2014which tourists travel thousands of miles to see\u2014as does\nthe Niagra Falls, a common creek mill pond, or as the works of nature\ntranscend the works of art.  And did not God know which was the longest\nriver on earth, and which, with its tributaries, watered the grandest\nregion of country on earth, Eden, when he said the garden was on it?\n\nWhen all these things shall be properly understood by the public, who will\nnot wish to come and see? Yes come and see!! \u201cBe not faithless, but\nbelieving,\u201d come and see!! And now may the King Eternal, banish the evil\none from this place forever, and build his promised \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d here,\nor to have an extensive one within our Palestine."
