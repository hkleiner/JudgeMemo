                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",

But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear!

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear!

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour: MILLET-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAmongst the great painters of peasant life the name of Jean Fran\u00e7ois\nMillet stands out prominently. A long interval elapsed betwixt the\ndeath of Adrian van Ostade and the birth of Millet, unbroken by a\nsingle name, with the solitary exception of Chardin, of a painter who\ngrasped the profundity of peasant life. In Holland and Flanders in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we find many painters who,\nwhilst living the humblest lives themselves, saw in their surroundings\nsuch material for treatment as has handed their names down to\nposterity. It is only quite recently that one of the greatest of all,\nPieter Brueghel the Elder, has come to occupy his proper position in\nthe world of art. Formerly he was looked upon as an eccentric painter,\nwhose subjects were generally of rather a coarse nature; who,\nmoreover, contented himself with depicting the droller side of the\nvillage life of his period, and consequently was not to be taken\nseriously. Of late years, however, an exhaustive research into his\nlife and works have revealed him as one of the greatest masters in his\nown sphere of any time. The wonderful series of pictures in Vienna,\nand the solitary examples scattered about the great collections of\nEurope, proclaim him not only a painter, but a philosopher as well.\n\nHis peasants, grotesque as they may now appear to us, possess a\nfidelity and vigour of handling such as none of his contemporaries\npossess. To him, consequently, we must look as the fountain-head of\nall peasant painting. His influence was immediately felt in the\nLow Countries, and there sprang up that wonderful school of which\nAdrian Brouwer, Jan Steen, and Adrian van Ostade are such brilliant\nexponents. In their more recent prototype--Millet--the same profound\nand sympathetic rendering of the everyday life of the simple peasant\nis to be found, tinged with the melancholy fervour of his temperament.\n\nTheir temperament bears the same relation to his as the seventeenth\ncentury does to the nineteenth. A more subdued temper had come over\nall classes of the community, a less boisterous attitude towards life,\nbut the struggle for existence was none the less strenuous or\nunending. The rollicking and reckless joy of Brouwer's peasants, with\ntheir hard drinking and lusty bawling, was an essential feature of\nDutch life of the period. But they are every whit as precious from an\nartistic and historical standpoint as are the placid interiors of\nMillet.\n\nDuring the two centuries which elapsed between these great masters\nmany changes had come over the lives of European people. The spread of\neducation, permeating down even to the lowest classes, had tended to\nthe sobering of habits; and the French peasant, with the partial\nuplifting and greater contact through more equitable distribution of\nthe land which the Revolution had bestowed upon him, was a quieter man\nthan his Dutch prototype who had preceded him by a couple of\ncenturies.\n\nIn Millet's rendering of the life he found around him, the same\nincisive truth and absorbing sincerity is to be found as in the\nDutchmen with whom I have compared him, and consequently Millet can be\nconsidered as a direct lineal descendant of the mighty Brueghel.\n\nThe entire absence of the Dutchmen's brutality in Millet's work is to\nbe accounted for, firstly, by the extreme gentleness of his own\ndisposition; and, secondly, by his study of some of the greatest\nmasters of the Italian renaissance. His keenness of perception can be\ngauged by his enthusiastic appreciation of Andrea Mantegna at a time\nwhen the merits of that master were not understood as they are to-day.\n\nMany of his noblest inspirations were conceived under the Paduan\npainter's influence, and one could cite many compositions in which the\ntrain of thought of the two masters seems to run upon parallel lines.\n\nUpon first regarding a picture of Millet's mature years, one wonders\nfrom whence come those subtleties of line and tone. There is nothing\nanalogous to them in the works of his contemporaries. The difference\ntoo between his early efforts and those of his later years is\nstupendous, but the lines which his development pursued are\nessentially due to the simplicity of the life he led and the high\nideal he invariably kept before him. Living, as he always did, a life\nof struggle, a never-ending battle against seemingly overwhelming\nodds, he was in a position to grasp the sorrows and troubles of the\nsimple folk by whom he was surrounded. He further saw that work,\nalthough they themselves were not aware of it, alone made life\nliveable to them. He shared their struggles in their most intense and\npoignant form. In fact when one contemplates the life which Millet\nled, both at Gr\u00e9ville and at Barbizon, with its strenuousness and\nearnestness, faced, moreover, with the ever-present dread of want, it\nis to be wondered that he had the courage to live his life as he did.\n\nIt has become the fashion lately to decry certain phases of his art. A\ncharge of sentimentality is urged against some of his most popular\nworks. The \"Angelus,\" about which many hard things have lately been\nsaid, is a case in point. It must be remembered that modern life,\nparticularly as lived in great cities such as London or Paris, does\nnot tend to foster those simple ideas upon religion, which the\npeasant, far removed from great centres of population, implicitly\naccepts. He is, as a rule, a man of but little education, who has\nheard nothing of the doubts and scepticisms with which townspeople of\nevery grade of society are so familiar. His ideas on religion are\nexactly those which have come to him from his parents, and he is\nincapable of doubting the elementary truths he was first taught. Such\nsimple ideas have departed from even the peasantry in most parts of\nFrance. Only in Brittany and in La Vend\u00e9e could one to-day encounter\nthe types Millet has portrayed for us in the \"Angelus.\"\n\nThe two figures in the foreground are symbolical of all that is most\ntouching in French peasant life. The end of the day has arrived, and\nafter many hours of unremitting toil, the ringing of the bell in the\ndistant tower proclaims the finish of another day. The wonderful still\natmosphere which envelops the far-stretching plain, the whole suffused\nwith the effects of a placid and glorious sunset, lends an intensity\nof poetical feeling which harmoniously blends with the placid nature\nof the theme. All around us we have evidence of man's perpetual\nstruggle with nature, the grim fight for subsistence, for life itself.\n\nThe ploughed field has yielded many a crop, the reward of arduous\nlabour expended in sowing and reaping. The small recompense to the\nlabourer himself is symbolised by the extreme poverty with which the\nman and woman are clothed, whilst the degrading nature of the toil, as\nin the far famous \"Man with the Hoe,\" is brought before us in the\nrugged types of the labourer and his wife. The only softening\ninfluence in their lives is that imparted by religion, and in choosing\nthis moment of the angelus for depicting them, Millet has brought\nbefore us in the most forcible form not only the degrading character\nof much of the toil which is entailed in producing the necessities of\nexistence, but also the danger of removing by any sudden change, no\nmatter how well intentioned, the consoling influence of religious\nbelief. A work into which such intense earnestness and melancholy\ntruth is infused can never be designated sentimental, except by those\nwho have not freely grasped the immense import of these qualities in\nthe production of great and enduring art. Brilliancy of technique and\nextraordinary facilities, if unsupported by a determination to convey\nsome message, will inevitably find its own level, whilst the painter\nwho possesses this supreme quality will assuredly come into his own.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that in considering the oil paintings of\nMillet, the subtleties of atmosphere and line can never be appreciated\nif one is not acquainted with the country he painted. No two countries\nare alike in atmospheric effect, and it is necessary, therefore, in\norder to appreciate an artist to the full, to have studied the country\nhe has chosen to depict. The outlines of the landscape, the very shape\nof the trees, the colour imparted by sunshine and clouds, differ\nmaterially in various districts, and consequently it behoves one to\nexercise caution before condemning this or that effect as being untrue\nto nature.\n\nIt may safely be said that as a painter, purely and simply, Millet\nwill never occupy a very high position in the world of art. He never\nbursts forth into any of those pyrotechnics which distinguished many\nof his contemporaries and some of the painters of our own days. His\nmanner of handling the brush is always restrained to the point of\ntimidity. By this I do not mean to imply that he could not paint in a\nlarge and bold manner; indeed on many occasions, as for example in the\n\"Sawyers,\" he has attained an astonishing degree of power. But as his\nwhole thoughts were directed to suppressing any tendencies towards\nvirtuosity, which might divert attention from the point he wished to\nillustrate, he frequently appears to achieve his ends by holding\nhimself in restraint.\n\nAnother dominant characteristic of Millet's art is that the instant he\nthrows off his sadly philosophic mood, he is no longer a great artist.\n\nFor example, in the well-known picture of \"La Baigneuse,\" he\nendeavours to draw himself into depicting the brighter side of life.\n\nIn a wood resplendent with the sunlit foliage of a glorious summer\nday, a young girl is about to enter the small river which runs\nplacidly between the moss-covered banks. In the distance a number of\nducks are disporting themselves in the water. Here is a theme which\nwould appeal irresistibly to a man of the temperament of Diaz; he\ncould impart the glories of colour as they were reflected from the\nmirror-like surface of the water, the shimmering of the trees and the\ndelicious effect of the balmy breeze as it rustled through the\nbranches. But in the hands of Millet it is nothing but a sad\ncomposition; the figure is well drawn; the ducks are admirably placed\nin the composition, and the trees treated with studious fidelity, but\nthere is that great indefinable something lacking which attracts us\ntowards the master when working in a sadder mood.\n\nMillet can be described as being more a philosopher than a painter.\n\nNot only in his great paintings, which by the way are not very\nnumerous, but in his drawings and etchings, we discover the mind of a\nman who has grappled with, and understood the great problems of life.\n\nPoor as he was, and remained all his life, it is doubtful whether\nriches or an improvement in circumstances would have brought him any\nincreased happiness. He loved the open country, and still more the\nsolitary peasant whom he found working in the fields, earning a bare\nsubsistence for himself and his little m\u00e9nage in the neighbouring\nvillage. His interest was divided between the man at his work and his\nwife and children in the m\u00e9nage. The simplest incidents of their\neveryday life did not escape him, and the smallest duty which would\nhave left unaffected a less observant nature has been made the subject\nof many a fine canvas.\n\nMillet seems particularly to have been impressed with the loneliness\nof the peasant's labour. Take, for example, that wonderfully luminous\ncanvas, \"The Sheep Pen.\" Here, in the midst of a vast plain, a large\nspace is marked out in which to enclose the sheep for the night. The\nsun, sinking low in the horizon, warns the shepherd that the time has\narrived for him to call together his flock and place them in safe\nquarters for the night. Accompanied by his faithful dog, he stands at\nthe opening of the pen allowing the sheep to enter two or three at a\ntime. There is no other living soul in sight. Alone he has kept guard\nover the flock during the long day, with no other company than his dog\nand his own thoughts. He is dead to the beauties of the landscape\naround him, and sees nothing more in a field than how much corn can be\nraised each year from it, or in the sheep he tends so carefully how\nmuch mutton it will make. He feels nothing of the glorious beauties of\nthe sunset, of which he is so often a witness; how it softens the\nlines of the horizon and suffuses the distant woods and plain with its\ngolden rays. He sees nothing of the changes momentarily occurring in\nthe sky: how the blues get fainter and fainter, how the clouds are\ntinged with opalescent hues, the shadows prolonging themselves as the\norb sinks deeper and deeper; or how, finally, when the sun has\ndisappeared, the whole heavens are lighted up in one blaze of glory.\n\nYet Millet would have us understand that in spite of this, the\nshepherd is performing a duty to humanity not to be underrated. The\nsheep he has so carefully and conscientiously reared will form food\nto-morrow for many a hungry town-dweller. Further, he would have us\nfollow the peasant as he closes the pen for the night and traces his\ntired steps towards his simple home in the village. The frugal and\nhard-earned meal, prepared for him by his wife, who like himself has\nhad her share of duties to occupy her during the day, is partaken of\nsurrounded by a hungry and joyous group of children. Such themes\nsuggested by the simplicity of his own life appealed to him with\nirresistible force, and it is in their portrayal that his greatness is\nmanifested.\n\nPerhaps no season of the year presented the same attraction for Millet\nas the spring. The period when all the earth after its long winter\nsleep is about to waken into new life seems to have always been a\nsource of inspiration to him. In \"The Sower\" he emphasises the fact\nthat the fruits of the harvest are not to be had without due labour\nbeing expended upon the earth. The sloping field, barren of\nvegetation, and crowned at the top with a small clump of trees, is\nbeing broken up by the distant plough drawn by two horses and guided\nby a peasant. The latter figure is one of the noblest of Millet's\ncreations. By his strained and ever-attentive attitude, by his\ncontinuous tramp over the rough and broken ground, he shows us the\nmonotony of his toil. He crosses the field in one direction, only to\nreturn at an interval of a few feet. In the foreground we have the\nsower, a middle-aged man of typical peasant type, on whose left side a\nbag of seeds is slung. With automatic precision he withdraws a\nhandful, and strews it into the furrows open to receive it. So long as\nhe continues in the same track his labour will be well performed, and\nhence his task is just as monotonous as that of his fellow-worker\nhigher up in the field. The silhouetting of these two figures against\nthe light is symbolical of the labour to be expended in life before\nresults are forthcoming.\n\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that in considering the works of\nMillet, one must not judge him from the standpoint of a mere painter.\n\nHis brush is only the means to an end, and by its means he is enabled\nto bring the fruits of his philosophic observation before us in\npermanent form. It has been charged against the \"Angelus\" that it was\nnot a remarkably fine piece of painting, that many a young artist of\nthe present generation is infinitely better equipped, technically\nspeaking, than the master who wrought this celebrated canvas. This may\nin a measure be true, but it must never be forgotten that Millet\nbrought into play exactly the means which could illustrate his meaning\nin the clearest terms. He had not intended, in painting such a\npicture, to produce a work which would astonish his fellow artists\nwith its brilliancy of handling or magnificence of colour. He wanted\nto make the beholder forget the painter and absorb the lesson. This\nquality runs right through the art of Millet, and it is from this\nstandpoint that we are obliged to weigh his merits.\n\n\nCHAPTER: MILLET'S EARLY LIFE\n\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois Millet was born on October 4, 1814, that is at the\nperiod when French art, at any rate as far as landscape painting is\nconcerned, had reached its lowest ebb. Throughout the eighteenth\ncentury the landscape painter had been hard put to make a living. The\ntaste of connoisseurs throughout the century had been for portraits\nand interiors, or for those numerous pastoral subjects which were\ncarried out with so much decorative charm by such men as Watteau and\nBoucher. Such landscape painting as existed was of the type\npopularised by Vernet; it was built upon a curious mixture of Italian\ninfluence coming from Panini and Salvator Rosa. The only evidence of\nrevolt against such a state of affairs we find in the works of Hubert\nRobert and Moreau. These two, and more especially would I direct the\nreader's attention to the latter, struggled hard to break down the\nconventionalities of the time. They endeavoured to infuse some sense\nof atmosphere into their pictures, and whilst frequently their trees\nand figures are painfully formal, they yet stand alone in the French\nschool as the pioneers of a phase of art which was to attain its\nzenith in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBut after the Revolution, and during the whole of the time that France\nwas under the domination of Napoleon, very rigid principles indeed\nwere enforced with regard to the direction that art should take. The\ninnovation which had its commencement in the reign of Louis XVI. swept\neverything before it as it gained force. Classical art and traditions\ndominated the whole French school, and no artist, however great his\nreputation, attempted for many years to swim against the stream. In\nspite of the principles of liberty and equality which were claimed for\nall under the new r\u00e9gime, a terribly strict eye was kept upon any\ninnovations which might break out in the form of a naturalistic art.\n\nThe directors of this new movement failed to see that the conditions\nwhich had produced the great Greek and Roman sculptors had passed\naway, and that the latter's supremacy was due to the fact that their\nproductions were symbolical of the loftiest thoughts of their own\nepoch. The art which expresses the ambitions and noblest thoughts of\nits time will alone endure. These expressions are not applicable to\nany other condition than those which called them forth, and hence in\nattempting to purify the rococo which had existed up to the middle of\nthe eighteenth century, by a return to classical traditions, they were\nonly copying that which their predecessors had done, and in so doing\nleft us without any original expression of their own time.\n\nInto such a condition of affairs was Millet born, and he was numbered\namongst that little band of men which included Rousseau, Corot, Dupr\u00e9,\nDiaz, and Daumier, who were to lay the foundations of the modern\nnaturalistic school. At the outset it was seemingly a hopeless\nstruggle they undertook; a struggle against prejudice and influence\nwhich was only to be brought to a victorious culmination after years\nof struggle and disappointment.

For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"
