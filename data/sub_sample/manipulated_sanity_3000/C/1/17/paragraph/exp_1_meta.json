                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.  Viewing the term, dissent,"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",

In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.  Viewing the term, dissent,"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.  Viewing the term, dissent,"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that, according to the Church\u2019s teaching,\nthere is no change in the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper.  As the water in\nbaptism remains water still, so the bread and wine of the Lord\u2019s Supper\nremain what they were before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it\nis true, to the Lord\u2019s service, but altogether unchanged by such\ndedication.\n\nBut we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions, for there\nis a special Article on the subject, viz., the twenty-eighth.  In the\nfirst clause we find the Lord\u2019s Supper described as both sacraments were\ndescribed in the twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a\nsign and means of grace.  \u2018The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of\nthe love which Christians ought to have among themselves one to another;\nbut rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ\u2019s death, inasmuch\nthat to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the\nbread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise\nthe cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\u2019  Having gone\nthus far in harmony with their general definition, and having quoted the\nwords from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly brought to the\nconsideration of the very point under discussion, viz., in what way does\nthe soul of the believer partake in the Lord\u2019s Supper of the body and\nblood of his blessed Lord and Saviour?  This question they boldly and\nclearly answer, declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the\nsecond place, what is, the truth respecting it.  They first declare that\nit is not by transubstantiation.  \u2018Transubstantiation (or the change of\nthe substance of bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be\nproved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,\noverthroweth the nature of a sacrament\u2019 (because if the sign is changed\ninto the thing signified, it ceases to be a sign), \u2018and hath given\noccasion to many superstitions.\u2019  It would be fruitless to endeavour to\ntrace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of the\nChurch of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the clear\nstatements of this pungent Article.  But their conclusion is one which is\nsuch an outrage on common sense that it would be utterly ludicrous if it\nwere not inexpressibly melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout\nmen, embracing it.  We are now deliberately told that the Article was not\ndirected against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a\nchange for which the name of \u2018transaccidentation\u2019 has been recently\nadopted.  Now I know we live in an age of discovery, but it is difficult\nfor any person of plain common sense, to believe in such a discovery as\nthis.  No one who knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be\nignorant of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of\ntransubstantiation was discussed.  In books, in sermons, in public\ndisputations, it was argued again and again, by all the most learned\ntheologians of the day.  The speculations of the schoolmen as well as the\nwritings of the early fathers were largely quoted.  The very distinction\nnow revived between substance and accident was carefully discussed.  And\nmen felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome and\nthe teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to save their\nlives.  The stake was before them as the certain issue of their\nconfession, and liberty and honour was the promised reward if only they\nwould yield.  But they had that deep conviction of the deadly error of\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation that they counted it a privilege\nrather to die than to deny the truth of God.  And I put it to any man of\ncommon sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe that, after\nall, there was no real difference between Rome and the Reformers?  That\nBonner and Gardiner, and Latimer, Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact,\nagree; that there might have been a little confusion in some of their\nminds as to the difference between substance and accident, so that they\nused the word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but\nthat in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires of\nSmithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were burned agreed\nwith them that burned them.  Clever men and learned men may put forth\nsuch a theory, but common sense revolts against it; and all thinking men\nmust agree that, if this be the only theory on which it can be\nmaintained, the doctrine of the Real Objective Presence is not the\ndoctrine of the Church.  Plain honest men will be ready to cry \u2018shame\u2019 on\nthose who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the plain\nand incontestable evidence of the great facts of the Reformation.  The\nReformers knew well enough what Rome meant by \u2018transubstantiation,\u2019 and\nthe twenty-eighth Article is decisive on the point that there is no such\nchange in the Supper of the Lord.\n\nBut the error having been denied, the next clause of the Article is\nemployed to assert the truth: \u2018The body of Christ is given, taken, and\neaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and spiritual manner; and the\nmeans whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is\nFaith.\u2019  It is most important to observe that word \u2018only,\u2019 for it is\nexclusive of all material feeding.  If it were not there it might have\nbeen possible to have argued that the Article admits the idea of a\nmaterial in addition to a spiritual feeding\u2014a feeding with the mouth as\nwell as a feeding with the heart.  But the word \u2018only\u2019 renders any such\ntheory impossible.  There is \u2018only\u2019 one manner in which He is received,\nand that one manner is heavenly and spiritual.  With equal clearness it\nis declared that as there is only one mode in which the body of our\nblessed Saviour is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is\nonly one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is\nfaith.  The Article does not speak of a means, as if it was one of many\nbut of \u2018the means\u2019 in order to",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of which I am the Pastor.  With\nMr. Perowne himself my acquaintance has been but slight, and I am left to\ngather my opinion of his character and ministry almost entirely from the\n\u201cObservations\u201d which he has published.  Those observations are of such a\nnature that it is impossible to reply to them either gravely or\nrespectfully; and I am quite of opinion that the most dignified course\nwould be, not to reply to them at all.  I fear however that some of the\nstatements which he has made, relative to the Infant Schools in this\ncity, and relative to the principles and conduct of the Dissenters, may\nbe believed by some persons, if they are not contradicted; and as he has\nchosen to make my \u201cLetter\u201d the occasion of propagating many slanders, I\nthink it due to the public to submit to the humiliation of replying to\nsuch an antagonist.\n\nI am persuaded that every man who read my \u201cLetter,\u201d with an \u201chonest\nheart,\u201d believed that my object in writing it was what I avowed; and that\nI wished my fellow-christians in this city to unite in educating Infants,\nbecause I thought that such an union would promote the interests of true\nreligion.  From the testimony of Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet, and from several\ncommunications which have been made to me, I am gratified with knowing\nthat the \u201cLetter\u201d has been received, by many religious and intelligent\npersons, in the spirit in which it professed to be written.  With their\ntestimony I am satisfied; and therefore Mr. Perowne must excuse me if I\ndo not strive to vindicate myself from his charges of hypocrisy and\nfalsehood.  As he is the accuser, I have no need to become the\nvindicator.  And all that I intend to do is to gather, from his own\n\u201cObservations,\u201d the evidence which they afford of his character and\ncompetency.\n\nAs Mr. Perowne is a clergyman who claims the attribute of \u201creverence,\u201d\nand who has solemnly declared that he was \u201cinwardly moved by the Holy\nGhost to take upon him this office,\u201d and \u201cthat he will maintain and set\nforward quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people,\u201d it was\nnot unreasonable to expect that his \u201cObservations\u201d would be in accordance\nwith his vows and professions.  I think, however, that I do not\nmisrepresent his publication when I say that none of the fruits of that\nSpirit, with which he professes to be \u201cinwardly moved,\u201d are to be found\nin it\u2014that it is abundantly fruitful in rude personalities, in wanton\nattacks on motives, in wilful distortions of the plainest language, in\npompous ignorance, and in supercilious pretensions\u2014and that all these\nqualities are left unredeemed even by the occasional introduction of\nbetter sentiments and feelings.  Sometimes a man will use hard words, or\nmanifest intemperate passions, under the influence of strongly exciting\ncircumstances.  But here a calm and dark spirit of evil reigns throughout\nthe whole of a pamphlet, which was written in the retirement of his\nstudy, and which he had no occasion to write at all.  This, however, is\nmere description, and we must analyze the \u201cObservations\u201d themselves in\norder to ascertain whether it be truth.\n\nOne prominent feature of the pamphlet is its utter dissimilarity, not\nonly to the Christian spirit which pervades Mr. Geary\u2019s Defence, but also\nto the speeches delivered at the Public Meeting, when the Infant School\nSociety was formed.  In them there is nothing ferocious, or insulting to\nany class of the community; but, on the other hand, an expression of\nrespectful regret that certain obstacles prevented, in the opinion of the\nspeakers, the formation of a more comprehensive society, which some of\nthem would certainly have preferred.  Whether, in the course of Mr. P\u2019s.\npamphlet, he alludes personally to any of those speakers, I will not take\nupon myself to determine.  But he vehemently denounces all Churchmen, who\nwould unite with Dissenters in an Infant School, as \u201ctraitors to the\nchurch,\u201d and as \u201cencouragers of dissimulation,\u201d \u201cwho help forward the\nruin of the church by echoing the sentiments of liberalism.\u201d  Not being\nacquainted with the gradations in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, I am\nunable to decide what rank he may hold among his brethren, or what\nauthority he may derive from the rectory of \u201cSt. John\u2019s.\u201d  But he\nevidently speaks of himself, and addresses himself to clergymen and\nothers oraculously, as if he were the Polyphemus of a party.  \u201cI tell\nthem,\u201d says he, \u201cin the name of every true son of the church.\u201d  \u201cI\nassure them that no true son of the church would listen to them.\u201d  \u201cWE\nsay to every churchman, profit by the lesson here taught you.\u201d  These,\nhowever, may be merely \u201cgreat swelling words of vanity,\u201d and I may be\nperfectly right in the conjecture that his brethren disown alike his\nauthority and his spirit, and are disposed to \u201cleave him alone with his\nglory.\u201d\n\nA considerable portion of Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet, consists of\nvituperations against the Dissenters.  Dissent, it is well known, is a\nrelative term, and is applied to such persons, in this country, as\nprofess to derive their doctrines and forms of church government from the\nScriptures, rather than from the liturgy and canons of the Church of\nEngland.  They believe that the Scriptures are sufficient to direct them\nin these matters; and they believe that their allegiance to Jesus Christ\nrequires them to submit to his supreme dominion as the only head of the\nchurch, and to reject the ecclesiastical authority which either\nProtestants or Papists may claim, but which Christ alone possesses.  On\nthis great principle they dissent from all establishments of religion by\nthe civil power; and they desire to stand quite independent of state\nendowments, and of state interference in their spiritual concerns, so as\nto constitute a \u201ckingdom which is not of this world.\u201d  Dissent therefore\ncan only be found in those countries where some particular form of\nreligion is established by the civil power.  There is no dissent in\nAmerica, because there is no Established Church there.  The government of\nthat country protects all denominations of Christians in the profession\nof their religion, but it does not elevate one denomination above the\nrest, nor does it prescribe to any denomination what forms of prayer they\nshall adopt, what doctrines they shall believe, or what bishops or\npastors they shall choose.
