                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",

Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"

                "-Hypochondriasis: A Practical Treatise-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION\n\n\n     \"When I first dabbled in this art, the old distemper call'd\n     Melancholy was exchang'd for Vapours, and afterwards for the\n     Hypp, and at last took up the now current appellation of the\n     Spleen, which it still retains, tho' a learned doctor of the\n     west, in a little tract he hath written, divides the Spleen and\n     Vapours, not only into the Hypp, the Hyppos, and the\n     Hyppocons; but subdivides these divisions into the Markambles,\n     the Moonpalls, the Strong-Fiacs, and the Hockogrokles.\"\n\n     Nicholas Robinson, A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and\n     Hypochondriack Melancholy (London, 1729)\n\nTreatises on hypochondriasis--the seventeenth-century medical term for a\nwide range of nervous diseases--were old when \"Sir\" John Hill, the\neccentric English scientist, physician, apothecary, and hack writer,\npublished his Hypochondriasis in 1766. For at least a century and a\nhalf medical writers as well as lay authors had been writing literature\nof all types (treatises, pamphlets, poems, sermons, epigrams) on this\nmost fashionable of English maladies under the variant names of\n\"melancholy,\" \"the spleen,\" \"black melancholy,\" \"hysteria,\" \"nervous\ndebility,\" \"the hyp.\" Despite the plethora of materia scripta on the\nsubject it makes sense to reprint Hill's Hypochondriasis, because it\nis indeed a \"practical treatise\" and because it offers the modern\nstudent of neoclassical literature a clear summary of the best thoughts\nthat had been put forth on the subject, as well as an explanation of the\ncauses, symptoms, and cures of this commonplace malady.\n\nNo reader of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English literature\nneeds to be reminded of the interest of writers of the period in the\ncondition--\"disease\" is too confining a term--hypochondriasis. Their\nconcern is apparent in both the poetry and prose of two centuries. From\nRobert Burton's Brobdingnagian exposition in The Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) to Tobias Smollett's depiction of the misanthropic and ailing\nMatthew Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771), and, of course, well into\nthe nineteenth century, afflicted heroes and weeping heroines populate\nthe pages of England's literature. There is scarcely a decade in the\nperiod 1600-1800 that does not contribute to the literature of\nmelancholy; so considerable in number are the works that could be placed\nunder this heading that it actually makes sense to speak of the\n\"literature of melancholy.\" A kaleidoscopic survey of this literature\n(exclusive of treatises written on the subject) would include mention of\nMilton's \"Il Penseroso\" and \"L'Allegro,\" the meditative Puritan and\nnervous Anglican thinkers of the Restoration (many of whose narrators,\nsuch as Richard Baxter, author of the Reliquiae Baxterianae, are\nafflicted), Swift's \"School of Spleen\" in A Tale of a Tub, Pope's\nhysterical Belinda in the \"Cave of Spleen,\" the melancholic \"I\" of\nSamuel Richardson's correspondence, Gray's leucocholy, the\npsychosomatically ailing characters of The Vicar of Wakefield and\nTristram Shandy, Boswell's Hypochondriack Papers (1777-1783)\ncontributed to the London Magazine, and such \"sensible\" and\n\"sensitive\" women as Mrs. Bennett and Miss Bates in the novels of Jane\nAusten. So great in bulk is this literature in the mid eighteenth\ncentury, that C. A. Moore has written, \"statistically, this deserves to\nbe called the Age of Melancholy.\" The vastness of this literature is\nsufficient to justify the reprinting of an unavailable practical\nhandbook on the subject by a prolific author all too little known.\n\nThe medical background of Hill's pamphlet extends further back than the\nseventeenth century and Burton's Anatomy. The ancient Greeks had\ntheorized about hypochondria: hypochondriasis signified a disorder\nbeneath (hypo) the gristle (chondria) and the disease was discussed\nprincipally in physiological terms. The belief that hypochondriasis was\na somatic condition persisted until the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury at which time an innovation was made by Dr. Thomas Sydenham. In\naddition to showing that hypochondriasis and hysteria (thought previously\nby Sydenham to afflict women only) were the same disease, Sydenham noted\nthat the external cause of both was a mental disturbance and not a\nphysiological one. He also had a theory that the internal and immediate\ncause was a disorder of the animal spirits arising from a clot and\nresulting in pain, spasms, and bodily disorders. By attributing the\nonset of the malady to mental phenomena and not to obstructions of the\nspleen or viscera, Sydenham was moving towards a psychosomatic theory of\nhypochondriasis, one that was to be debated in the next century in\nEngland, Holland, and France. Sydenham's influence on the physicians\nof the eighteenth century was profound: Cheyne in England, Boerhaave in\nHolland, La Mettrie in France. Once the theory of the nervous origins of\nhypochondria gained ground--here I merely note coincidence, not historical\ncause and effect--the disease became increasingly fashionable in England,\nparticularly among the polite, the aristocratic, and the refined. Students\nof the drama will recall Scrub's denial in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707)\nof the possibility that Archer has the spleen and Mrs. Sullen's\ninterjection, \"I thought that distemper had been only proper to people of\nquality.\"\n\nToward the middle of the eighteenth century, hypochondria was so\nprevalent in people's minds and mouths that it soon assumed the\nabbreviated name \"the hyp.\" Entire poems like William Somervile's The\nHyp: a Burlesque Poem in Five Canto's (1731) and Tim Scrubb's A Rod\nfor the Hyp-Doctor (1731) were devoted to this strain; others, like\nMalcom Flemyng's epic poem, Neuropathia: sive de morbis hypochondriacis\net hystericis, libri tres, poema medicum (1740), were more technical\nand scientific. Professor Donald Davie has written that he has often\n\"heard old fashioned and provincial persons \neven in  own lifetime say, 'Oh, you give me the hyp,' where we\nshould say 'You give me a pain in the neck'\"; and I myself have heard\nthe expression, \"You give me the pip,\" where \"pip\" may be a corruption\nof \"hyp.\" As used in the early eighteenth century, the term \"hyp\" was\nperhaps not far from what our century has learned to call Angst. It\nwas also used as a synonym for \"lunacy,\" as the anonymous author of\nAnti-Siris (1744), one of the tracts in the tar-water controversy,\ninforms us that \"Berkeley tells his Countrymen, they are all mad, or\nHypochondriac, which is but a fashionable name for Madness.\" Bernard\nMandeville, the Dutch physician and author of The Fable of the Bees,\nseems to have understood perfectly well that hypochondriasis is a\ncondition encompassing any number of diseases and not a specific and\nreadily definable ailment; a condition, moreover, that hovers\nprecariously and bafflingly in limbo between mind and body, and he\nstressed this as the theme of his Treatise of the Hypochondriack and\nHysteric Passions, Vulgarly Call'd the Hypo in Men and Vapours in Women\n(1711). The mental causes are noted as well in an anonymous pamphlet in\nthe British Museum, A Treatise on the Dismal Effects of\nLow-Spiritedness (1750) and are echoed in many similar early and\nmid-eighteenth century works. Some medical writers of the age, like\nNicholas Robinson, had reservations about the external mental bases of\nthe hyp and preferred to discuss the condition in terms of internal\nphysiological causes:\n     ...of that Disorder we call the Vapours, or Hypochondria; for\n     they have no material distinctive Characters, but what arise from\n     the same Disease affecting different Sexes, and the Vapours in\n     Women are term'd the Hypochondria in Men, and they proceed from\n     the Contraction of the Vessels being depress'd a little beneath the\n     Balance of Nature, and the Relaxation of the Nerves at the same\n     Time, which creates that Uneasiness and Melancholy that naturally\n     attends Vapours, and which generally is an Intemperature of the\n     whole Body, proceeding from a Depression of the Solids beneath the\n     Balance of Nature; but the Intemperature of the Parts is that\n     Peculiar Disposition whereby they favour any Disease.\n\nBut the majority of medical thinkers had been persuaded that the\ncondition was psychosomatic, and this belief was supported by research\non nerves by important physicians in the 1740's and 1750's: the Monro\nbrothers in London, Robert Whytt in Edinburgh, Albrecht von Haller in\nLeipzig. By mid century the condition known as the hyp was believed to\nbe a real, not an imaginary ailment, common, peculiar in its\nmanifestations, and indefinable, almost impossible to cure, producing\nvery real symptoms of physical illness, and said to originate sometimes\nin depression and idleness. It was summed up by Robert James in his\nMedicinal Dictionary (London, 1743-45):\n     If we thoroughly consider its Nature, it will be found to be a\n     spasmodico-flatulent Disorder of the Primae Viae, that is, of the\n     Stomach and Intestines, arising from an Inversion or Perversion of\n     their peristaltic Motion, and, by the mutual consent of the Parts,\n     throwing the whole nervous System into irregular Motions, and\n     disturbing the whole Oeconomy of the Functions.... no part or\n     Function of the Body escapes the Influence of this tedious and long\n     protracted Disease, whose Symptoms are so violent and numerous,\n     that it is no easy Task either to enumerate or account for them....\n\n     No disease is more troublesome, either to the Patient or Physician,\n     than hypochondriac Disorders; and it often happens, that, thro' the\n     Fault of both, the Cure is either unnecessarily protracted, or\n     totally frustrated; for the Patients are so delighted, not only\n     with a Variety of Medicines, but also of Physicians.... On the\n     contrary, few physicians are sufficiently acquainted with the true\n     Genius and Nature of this perplexing Disorder; for which Reason\n     they boldly prescribe almost everything contained in the Shops, not\n     without an irreparable Injury to the Patient (article on\n     \"Hypochondriacus Morbis\").\n\nThis is a more technical description than Hill gives anywhere in his\nhandbook, but it serves well to summarize the background of the condition\nabout which Sir John wrote.\n\nHill's Hypochondriasis adds little that is new to the theory of the\ndisease. It incorporates much of the thinking set forth by the writings\nmentioned above, particularly those of George Cheyne, whose medical\nworks The English Malady (1733) and The Natural Method of Cureing the\nDiseases of the Body, and the Disorders of the Mind Depending on the\nBody (1742) Hill knew. He is also conversant with some Continental\nwriters on the subject, two of whom--Isaac Biberg, author of The\nOeconomy of Nature (1751), and Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9aumur who had written a history\nof insects (1722)--he mentions explicitly, and with William\nStukeley's Of the Spleen (1723). Internal evidence indicates that Hill\nhad read or was familiar with the ideas propounded in Richard\nBlackmore's Treatise of the Spleen and Vapours (1725) and Nicholas\nRobinson's A New System of the Spleen, Vapours, and Hypochondriack\nMelancholy (1729).\n\nHill's arrangement of sections is logical: he first defines the\ncondition (I), then proceeds to discuss persons most susceptible to it\n(II), its major symptoms (III), consequences (IV), causes (V), and cures\n(VI-VIII). In the first four sections almost every statement is\ncommonplace and requires no commentary (for example, Hill's opening\nremark: \"To call the Hypochondriasis a fanciful malady, is ignorant and\ncruel. It is a real, and a sad disease: an obstruction of the spleen by\nthickened and distempered blood; extending itself often to the liver,\nand other parts; and unhappily is in England very frequent: physick\nscarce knows one more fertile in ill; or more difficult of cure.\") His\nbelief that the condition afflicts sedentary persons, particularly\nstudents, philosophers, theologians, and that it is not restricted to\nwomen alone--as some contemporary thinkers still maintained--is also\nimpossible to trace to a single source, as is his description (p. 12) of\nthe most prevalent physiological symptoms (\"lowness of spirits, and\ninaptitude to motion; a disrelish of amusements, a love of solitude....\n\nWild thoughts; a sense of fullness\") and causes (the poor and damp\nEnglish climate and the resultant clotting of blood in the spleen) of\nthe illness.\n\nSections V-VIII, dealing with causes and cures, are less commonplace and\ndisplay some of Hill's eccentricities as a writer and thinker. He uses\nthe section entitled \"Cures\" as a means to peddle his newly discovered\ncure-all, water dock, which Smollett satirized through the mouth of\nTabitha Bramble in Humphry Clinker (1771). Hill also rebelled against\ncontemporary apothecaries and physicians who prescribed popular\nmedicines--such as Berkeley's tar-water, Dover's mercury powders, and\nJames's fever-powders--as universal panaceas for the cure of the hyp.\n\n\"No acrid medicine must be directed, for that may act too hastily,\ndissolve the impacted matter at once, and let it loose, to the\ndestruction of the sufferer; no antimonial, no mercurial, no martial\npreparation must be taken; in short, no chymistry: nature is the shop\nthat heaven has set before us, and we must seek our medicine there\"\n\n(p. 24). However scientifically correct Hill may have been in minimizing\nthe efficacy of current pills and potions advertised as remedies for the\nhyp, he was unusual for his time in objecting so strongly to them. Less\neccentric was his allegiance to the \"Ancients\" rather than to the\n\"Moderns\" so far as chemical treatment (i.e., restoration of the humours\nby chemical rearrangement) of hypochondriasis is concerned. \"The\nvenerable ancients,\" Hill writes, \"who knew not this new art, will lead\nus in the search; and (faithful relators as they are of truth) will tell\nus whence we may deduce our hope; and what we are to fear\" (p. 24).\n\nStill more idiosyncratic, perhaps, is Hill's contention (p. 25) that the\nair of dry, high grounds worsens the condition of the patient. Virtually\nevery writer I have read on the subject believed that onset of the hyp\nwas caused by one of the six non-naturals--air, diet, lack of sufficient\nsleep, too little or too much exercise, defective evacuation, the\npassions of the mind; and although some medical writers emphasized the\nlast of these, few would have concurred with Hill that the fetid air\nof London was less harmful than the clearer air at Highgate. All readers\nof the novel of the period will recall the hypochondriacal Matt\nBramble's tirade against the stench of London air. Beliefs of the\nvariety here mentioned cause me to question Hill's importance in the\nhistory of medicine; there can be no question about his contributions to\nthe advancement of the science of botany through popularization of\nLinnaeus' system of bisexual classification, but Hill's medical\nimportance is summarized best as that of a compiler. His recommendation\nof the study of botany as a cure for melancholics is sensible but verges\non becoming \"a digression in praise of the author,\" a poetic apologia\npro vita sua in Augustan fashion:\n     For me, I should advise above all other things the study of nature.\n\n     Let him begin with plants: he will here find a continual pleasure,\n     and continual change; fertile of a thousand useful things; even of\n     the utility we are seeking here. This will induce him to walk; and\n     every hedge and hillock, every foot-path side, and thicket, will\n     afford him some new object. He will be tempted to be continually in\n     the air; and continually to change the nature and quality of the\n     air, by visiting in succession the high lands and the low, the\n     lawn, the heath, the forest. He will never want inducement to be\n     abroad; and the unceasing variety of the subjects of his\n     observation, will prevent his walking hastily: he will pursue his\n     studies in the air; and that contemplative turn of mind, which in\n     his closet threatened his destruction, will thus become the great\n     means of his recovery (pp. 26-27).\n\nHill was forever extolling the claims of a life devoted to the study of\nnature, as we see in a late work, The Virtues of British Herbs (1770).\n\nJudicious as is the logic of this recommendation, one cannot help but\nfeel that the emphasis here is less on diversion as a cure and more on\nthe botanic attractions of \"every hedge and hillock, every foot-path\nside, and thicket.\"\n\nWhile Hill's rules and regulations regarding proper diet (Section VII)\nare standard, several taken almost verbatim et literatim from Cheyne's\nlist in The English Malady (1733), his recommendation (Section VIII)\nof \"Spleen-Wort\" as the best medicine for the hypochondriac patient is\nnot. Since Hill devotes so much space to the virtues of this herb and\nconcludes his work extolling this plant, a word should be said about it.\n\nThroughout his life he was an active botanist. Apothecary, physician,\nand writer though he was, it was ultimately botany that was his ruling\npassion, as is made abundantly clear in his correspondence. Wherever\nhe lived--whether in the small house in St. James's Street or in the\nlarger one on the Bayswater Road--he cultivated an herb garden that\nflattered his knowledge and ability. Connoisseurs raved about its\nspecies and considered it one of the showpieces of London. His arrogant\npersonality alone prevented him from becoming the first Keeper of the\nApothecary's Garden in Chelsea, although he was for a time\nsuperintendent to the Dowager Princess of Wales's gardens at Kensington\nPalace and at Kew. His interest in cultivation of herbs nevertheless\ncontinued; over the years Hill produced more than thirty botanical\nworks, many of them devoted to the medical virtues of rare herbs such as\n\"Spleen-Wort.\" Among these are The British Herbal (1756), On the\nVirtues of Sage in Lengthening Human Life (1763), Centaury, the Great\nStomachic (1765), Polypody (1768), A Method of Curing Jaundice\n(1768), Instances of the Virtue of Petasite Root (1771), and Twenty\nFive New Plants (1773). It is therefore not surprising that he\nshould believe a specific herb to be the best remedy for a complicated\nmedical condition. Nor is his reference to the Ancients as authority for\nthe herbal pacification of an inflamed spleen surprising in the light of\nhis researches: he was convinced that every illness could be cured by\ntaking an appropriate herb or combination of herbs. Whereas a few\nnonmedical writers--such as John Wesley in Primitive Physick\n(1747)--had advocated the taking of one or two herbs in moderate dosage\nas anti-hysterics (the eighteenth-century term for all cures of the\nhyp), no medical writer of the century ever promoted the use of herbs to\nthe extent that Hill did. In fairness to him, it is important to note\nthat his herbal remedies were harmless and that many found their way\ninto the official London Pharmacopeia. \"The virtues of this smooth\nSpleen-wort,\" he",
                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris, he was\n\"nominated\" to the Academy. He had but to present an Historical\nPainting in order to take his seat as an Academician.\n\n\nCHAPTER: VENUS AND MARRIAGE\n\n\nBack in his beloved Paris again; thrilled by the atmosphere and gaiety\nof its merry life; in the full vigour of manhood on the eve of his\nthirties; amongst congenial friends; done with the drudgery of winning\nto Academic honour, Boucher saw that the public were not falling over\neach other to purchase religious or historic pictures; he straightway\nturned his back upon these things, and on the edge of his thirtieth\nyear he gave to the world his \"Marriage of the Children of God with\nthe Children of Men,\" in which Venus is the avowed mistress of his\nadoration. It caused a fine stir, and greatly increased his repute.\n\nIn this picture he ends his Italian period and strikes his own\npersonal note. Both this and the \"Venus asking arms for Aeneas from\nVulcan,\" together with the \"Birth of Adonis\" and the \"Death of\nAdonis,\" of about the same period, still show Boucher strongly under\nthe influence of his master, Lemoyne. Indeed, the \"Birth\" and \"Death\nof Adonis,\" their record lost during the scuffle and confusion of the\nRevolution, for long hung side by side as pictures by Lemoyne, until,\nbeing cleaned about 1860, Boucher's initials were discovered upon\nthem, and, contemporary engravings being hunted up, still further\nproved their origin. But in the Venus that now figures in all his\nworks there is that flesh-painting of the nude, and that rosy touch\nupon the flesh of the female figure, that are a far more certain\nsignature of Boucher's handiwork than any written name.\n\nUnfortunately the Salons were closed during Boucher's earlier years\nuntil he was thirty-four, and the record of his work during these\nyears is difficult to follow; but with his service to Venus his\npersonal career begins, and the stream of his Venus-pieces steadily\nflows from his hands.\n\nHe came to her service rid of all prentice essays in craftsmanship, a\nfinished and consummate artist. He found in his subject a goddess to\nwhom he could devote his great and splendid gifts. He painted her\ndainty body with a radiant delight and a rare colour-sense such as\nFrance had never before seen or uttered. He remains to this day the\nfirst painter of the subtle, delicate, and elusive thing that is\nfemininity; he caught her allure, her charm, as he was to catch the\nfragrance and charm of children and flowers; and he set the statement\nof these things upon canvas as they have never been uttered.\n\nThe whole of his life long, Boucher gave himself up with equal and\npassionate devotion to work and to pleasure--working at his easel\noften twelve hours of his day without losing, to the end when the\nbrush fell from his dead fingers, his blitheness of heart or his\ngenerosity of act, and without weakening the pleasure-loving desires\nof his gadding spirit. Out of his splendid toil he made the means to\nindulge his tastes for pleasure; and the gratifying of his tastes in\nturn renewed and created the ideas that made the subjects of his\nartistry. He brought to all he did a joy in the doing that made of his\nvast labour one long pleasure--of his pleasures a riot of industry. He\nplayed as he toiled, scarce knowing which was play and which toil.\n\nThe gossip of his love-affairs makes no romantic story--they were but\ncommonplace ecstasies with unknown frail women. But hard as he worked\nand lived and played, he found time to get himself married in his\nthirtieth year to pretty seventeen-year-old Marie Jeanne Buseau, a\nlittle Parisian--and for love of her, so far as he understood the\nbusiness; for she brought him no dowry.\n\nThe young couple settled down for the next ten years in the Rue\nSaint-Thomas-du-Louvre. Here Boucher lived through his thirties.\n\nMadame was a pretty creature, if we had but Latour's pastel portrait\nalone to prove it. But the pretty features were the crown to as pretty\na body, for she sat often to her lord; and it is clear from his\ncorrespondence with a friend, Bachaumont, that she is the Psyche of\nhis illustrated fable--and Psyche runs much to the Altogether.\n\nMarriage, however, was not likely to imprison Boucher's gadding eyes;\nand it did not. Madame Boucher seems to have had as frail a heart, and\navoided strife by amusing herself, amongst others, with the Swedish\nAmbassador, Count de Tessin, who, to gain access to the lady,\ncommissioned Boucher to do the Watteau-like illustrations to\nAcajou--a dull affair. Boucher's pretty wife, herself no mean\nartist, worked in his studio, and painted several smaller canvases\nafter his pictures, gaining some fame as a miniaturist and engraver.\n\nNor did Marriage turn Boucher from his art. Two years were gone by\nsince his nomination to the Academy; he had now to paint the formal\nHistorical Picture and present it in order to take his seat as\nAcademician; and it was in this his thirtieth year that he painted and\nwon his academic rank with the \"Renauld et Armide\" now at the Louvre.\n\nHere he sufficiently subordinated his own style to the academic to\nensure success; and the work was hailed by Academicians and critics,\nincluding Diderot, with enthusiasm. But even here we have his cupids\npeeping round the mythologic event; and Armide herself has pretty\nFrench lips that knew no Greek.\n\nOnce secure of his position, he straightway flung the last remnants of\nthe academic style out of his studio door; and it is a grim comment on\ncriticism that it was just exactly in proportion as he developed his\nown personal genius and uttered the France of his day, that he was\nattacked; whilst the stilted things that he knew were third-rate, and\nwhich he wholly rejected from henceforth, were exactly the things that\nwere praised!\n\nHis election to the Academy, and the enthusiasm over the picture that\nwon him his seat thereat, brought his name before the young king; the\nfollowing year he received his first order from the Court whose\npainter he was destined to become. The decorations in the queen's\napartments were gloomy and had grown black; and he painted in their\nstead the \"Charity,\" \"Abundance,\" \"Fidelity,\" and \"Prudence\" still\nthere to be seen. Indeed, with his gay vision, his pretty habit of\nculling only the flowers from the garden of life, and his quickness to\nset down the pleasing thing in every prospect, Boucher was the\ndestined painter of a",
                "-The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal\n\n\nCHAPTER: IS THERE A COUNTERFEIT WITHOUT A GENUINE?\n\n\nMy object in this lesson is to present the myths, the ancient, fictitious\nand fanciful narratives concerning the gods, in such a manner as to enable\nyou to see the utter absurdity of the idea that the religion of the Bible\nis of mythical origin. Myths are fictitious narratives, having an\nanalogy more or less remote to something real. From this definition you\ndiscover that a myth is always a counterfeit, and as such always appears\nin evidence in favor of something more or less remote, that is true. Now,\nif the Bible had a mythical origin, it sustains some analogy to something\nfound in the mythical or fictitious and fanciful narratives concerning the\ngods, and is therefore the myth of a myth; the counterfeit of a\ncounterfeit. If such be the truth in the case, where do we find the origin\nof the myths from which \u201cBible myths\u201d have descended? Is it found in the\ntrue God presiding over the elements of nature and the destinies of men,\nas well as the events of creation and providence? Or, can it be possible\nthat we have many counterfeits without a genuine? Many myths sustaining\nno analogy, either near or remote, to anything real? It is an absurdity,\ndestructive of the term employed, because myths cease to be myths\nwithout some near or remote relation to realities. They must sustain\nsome analogy to something real. And counterfeits also cease to be\ncounterfeits when it is shown that they sustain no relation, through\nanalogy or likeness, to anything that is genuine. In the mythical systems\nof olden times we have, in the midst of a vast deal of false and fanciful\nnarrative concerning subordinate and secondary gods, evidence of a supreme\nGod presiding over all things; and the secondary gods performing many\nthings which belonged to the province of the \u201cAlmighty One,\u201d with many\ndegrading, vile and corrupting habits.\n\nA letter written by Maximus, a Numidian, to Augustin, reads thus: \u201cNow,\nthat there is a sovereign God, who is without beginning, and who, without\nhaving begotten anything like unto Himself, is, nevertheless, the Father\nand the former of all things, what man can be gross and stupid enough to\ndoubt? He it is of whom, under different names, we adore the eternal power\nextending through every part of the world, thus honoring separately by\ndifferent sorts of worship what may be called His several members, we\nadore Him entirely. May those subordinate gods preserve you under whose\nnames, and by whom all we mortals upon earth adore the common Father of\ngods and men.\u201d In this letter we have a clear presentation of the mythical\nsystem concerning the ancient gods, and also the \u201canalagous relation\u201d to\nthe \u201cMaster God.\u201d Each god having his particular dominion over place or\npassion, appears before us as a representative of the supreme, or \u201cMaster\nGod;\u201d and by worshiping each member or God they claimed to adore entirely\nthe \u201ccommon Father of gods and men.\u201d Augustin answers, In your public\nsquare there are two statues of Mars, one naked, the other armed; and\nclose by the figure of a man who, with three fingers advanced towards\nMars, holds in check that divinity so dangerous to the whole town. With\nregard to what you say of such gods being portions of the only \u201ctrue God,\u201d\n\nI take the liberty you gave me to warn you not to fall into such a\nsacrilege; for that only God, of whom you speak, is doubtless He who is\nacknowledged by the whole world, and concerning whom, as some of the\nancients have said, the ignorant agree with the learned. Now, will you say\nthat Mars, whose strength is represented by an inanimate man, is a portion\nof that God? That is to say, the dead statue controls Mars, and Mars is a\nsubordinate god representing the infinite God, and is, therefore, a part\nof that God. Augustin adds, Not the Pantheon and all the temples\nconsecrated to the inferior gods, nor even the temples consecrated to the\ntwelve greater gods prevented \u201cDeus Optimus Maximus,\u201d God most good, most\ngreat, from being acknowledged throughout the empire. Voltaire says, \u201cIn\nspite of all the follies of the people who venerated secondary and\nridiculous gods, and in spite of the Epicurians, who in reality\nacknowledged none, it is verified that in all times the magistrates and\nwise adored one sovereign God.\u201d Secondary gods were myths, counterfeits,\nsustaining the relation of counterfeits. The ancients attributed their\nown passions to the \u201cMaster God,\u201d and had subordinate gods representing\npassions. They also had a god for each part of His dominion; and these\ngods they called members of the true God, and claimed to worship Him, by\nworshiping all the members or gods. Mars was the god of war; Bacchus was\nthe god of drunkenness. They had a god for this and a god for that. The\nancient pagans seemed to think that infinite divisibility belonged to the\n\u201ctrue God,\u201d for they distinguished between passions, and divided up the\nuniverse among the gods until they had it crammed full of subordinate and\nridiculous gods, each one a member of Jehovah, and each member a part of\nthe great mythical system.\n\nNow, in order to establish the proposition that our religion is of\nmythical origin, it is necessary to show, first, that the Bible was\nwritten this side of or during the age of myths, and, having done this, it\nis necessary to show that the Hebrew people were a mythical people;\nneither of which can be accomplished. It will not be amiss to present in\nthis connection a statement given by Justin to the Greeks. He says: \u201cOf\nall your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, philosophers, or\nlaw-givers, by far the oldest, as the Greek historians show us, was\nMoses.... For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets\nhave supposed to have been earth-born\u2014that is, to have sprung from the\nsoil, and hence one of the oldest inhabitants\u2014the aborigines, Moses is\nmentioned as the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation.\u201d He is mentioned\nas a very ancient and time-honored prince in the Athenian, Attic and\nGrecian histories. Polemon, in his first book of Hellenics, mentions Moses\nas the leader and ruler of the Jewish nation. Ptolem\u00e6us, in his history of\nEgypt, bears the same testimony. Apion, an Egyptian writer, in his book\nagainst the Jews, says \u201cMoses led them.\u201d Dr. Shaw, a modern traveler, says\nthe inhabitants of Corondel, on the eastern side of the Red Sea, to this\nday preserve the remembrance of the deliverance of the children of Israel\nfrom their bondage in Egypt. Diodorus, the most renowned Greek historian,\nwho employed thirty years epitomizing the libraries, and traveled over\nAsia and Europe for the sake of great accuracy, who wrote forty volumes of\nhistory, says he learned from the Egyptian priests that Moses was an\nancient law-giver.\n\nIt seems to us that, no sane man, who is acquainted with the ancient\nmythicals, can regard the religion of the Bible as a child of mythical\ndescent. It is as deadly in its influence upon those myths, and all\nmythical worship, as it could be made by an infinite mind.\n\nVoltaire says \u201cthe character of the mythical gods is ridiculous;\u201d we will\nadd, it is ridiculous in the extreme. Listen\u2014Hesiod, in his theogony,\nsays: \u201cChronos, the son of Ouranos, or Saturn, son of Heaven, in the\nbeginning slew his father, and possessed himself of his rule, and, being\nseized with a panic lest he should suffer in the same way, he preferred\ndevouring his children, but Curetes, a subordinate god, by craft, conveyed\nJupiter away in secret and afterwards bound his brother with chains, and\ndivided the empire, Jupiter receiving the air, and Neptune the deep, and\nPluto Hades.\u201d\n\nPros-er-pi-ne, Mella-nip-pe, Neptune, Pluto and Jupiter are all set forth\nin the mythical writings as adulterers. Jupiter was regarded as more\nfrequently involved in that crime, being set down as guilty in many\ninstances. For the love of Sem-e-le, it is said that he assumed wings and\nproved his own unchastity and her jealousy. These are some of the exploits\nof the sons of Saturn. Hercules was celebrated by his three nights, sung\nby the poets for his successful labors.\n\nThe son of Jupiter slew the Lion, and destroyed the many-headed Hydra; was\nable to kill the fleet man-eating birds, and brought up from hades the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus; effectually cleansed the Augean stable from\nits refuse; killed the bulls and stag whose nostrils breathed fire; slew\nthe poisonous serpent and killed Ach-e-l\u00f2-us. The guest-slaying Bu-s\u00ed-ris\nwas delighted with being stunned by the cymbals of the Sat-yrs, and to be\nconquered with the love of women; and at last, being unable to take the\ncloak off of Nessus, he kindled his own funeral pile and died. Such are\nspecimens of the ancient myths. Their character is such as to leave an\nimpassible gulf between them and the character of the God revealed in our\nreligion. No development theory, seeking the origin of our religion in the\nold mythical system, can bridge across this chasm. It is as deep and broad\nas the distance between the antipodes. There is no analogy between these\ncounterfeits or myths and the \u201ctrue God,\u201d save that remote power of God\nwhich is divided up and parceled out among them. Their morals were the\nworst. The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of\nhuman apostacy from the \u201ctrue God.\u201d Homer introduces Zeus in love, and\nbitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the\nother gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars\nand Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \u201cGreat Pluto\u2019s self the\nstinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very\ngates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the\nhigh Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft\nremained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\u201d In the\nmythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.\n\nHomer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the\nocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and\nphilosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \u201cGod of Gods,\u201d,\nruns through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,\nand, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character\nascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient\nmyths. They hold the \u201cMaster God\u201d before us only in connection with power,\nbeing altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as\nto attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,\n\u201cThe utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his\nimperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then\nbecome worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\u201d This was\nverified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without\ndoubt.\n\n\u201cThe character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all\nits powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no\nlanguage containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness\nand abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or\ninto which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in\norder to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a\npure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and\nrule of life.\u201d\n\nThe history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony\nthat their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and\nliving God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,\nself-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely\nextinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets\nwere great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods\nthere is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme\nin power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.\n\nThe age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The\nevidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these\nwords: \u201cIt was the generation then the tenth, of men endowed with\nspeech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and\nKronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the\nnoblest sons, and named them so, because of men endowed with gift of\nspeech, they were the first,\u201d that is to say, they were orators, \u201cand\nothers for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their\nart. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers\nthemselves assuming it, obtained the name, some from fear, others from\nreverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward\ntheir subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after\nadopted the worship without examination.\u201d So testifies one who was\nschooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between\nthe Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were\nnone, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a\ncounterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.\n\nThe points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact\nthat the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom\nthey conceived to be the \u201cGod of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThose who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the\nanalogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned\ngentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he\nremarked, \u201cthere is a very fine piece of wheat.\u201d The man had been\nbrought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats\nand wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an\nold-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took\nhold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:\n\u201cIt looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\u201d It is very\nnatural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves\nfamiliar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into\nerror by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have\nbecome acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the\nflax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked\nupon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed\nof chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat\nand oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month\nof June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man\nwill make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths\nand mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand\nthings, very different in character and origin, which have points of\nsimilitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.\n\nWhile the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their\nworship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and\nintelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high\nand broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every\nennobling and lovable attribute.\n\nThere is an old myth in the Vedas\u2014a god called \u201cChrishna.\u201d The Vedas claim\nthat he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in\nflowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is\nsurprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \u201cChrishna\u201d in\ncomparison with the Greek term \u201cChristos\u201d\u2014Christ, and confound the two.\n\nThe words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no\nmore alike than the terms catechist\u2014one who instructs by questions and\nanswers, and the term catechu\u2014a dry, brown astringent extract. We could\ngive many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon\nthe Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such\nmen, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and\ncharacter, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the\nRomans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \u201cFather of\nGods and men\u201d\u2014\u201cthe God of gods,\u201d the \u201cMaster of the gods.\u201d Voltaire says:\nIt is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not\nbecome the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their\nJupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was\nalways considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not\nJupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,\nfrom the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was Jov,\nJovis; among the Greeks, Zeus; among the Phonecians and Syrians and\nEgyptians, Jehovah. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of\nGod\u2014denoting permanent being\u2014in perfect keeping with the Bible title or\ndescriptive appellation, \u201cI AM THAT I AM.\u201d\n\nThe ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, power and\nrelation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than\nclothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities\u2014and then place\nhim above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling\nin all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to\nthe gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed\nJupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any\nother god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient\nidolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that\ntheir system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were\ndestitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the\ndivine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt\nlives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and\npresented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite\nof the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the\ndistance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the\nlowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven\u2019s own spotless life. I love\nthe religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost\nknowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus\u2014the only perfect model\nknown in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the\nflesh; make it your own, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American\ninfidel, said: \u201cFar be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,\nthe amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his\nfollowers.\u201d\n\nIt is now conceded that Jesus Christ was no myth by all the great minds\nin unbelief. He lived. We",
                "-THE HOUSE OF DELIGHT-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE\n\n\nBetsey was a curly-headed little girl, nine years old, who played with\nher dolls in the most interesting way you ever saw. Little Mrs. Delight,\nwith her soft brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, was Betsey\u2019s very\ndearest doll, and she played most of the time with her, and her charming\nlittle husband, Mr. Delight. But Betsey\u2019s sister Anne, who was away at\nschool and who was much too old to play with dolls any more, had given\nMr. and Mrs. Darling to Betsey, for it did seem too bad to keep them\npacked away in their dark, stuffy box.\n\nNow, Betsey didn\u2019t call herself the dolls\u2019 mother, for they were all\ngrown up, and much older than she was already. And they seemed to need a\nnew chair or a new bed so very often, that a carpenter was necessary\nmost of the time. So whenever Mr. Delight wished to order new furniture,\nBetsey called herself Mr. Betts, and talked exactly like a carpenter.\n\nWhen Mrs. Delight needed new dresses or new curtains, Betsey called\nherself Madame Bettina, and talked as nearly as she could like Mother\u2019s\nFrench dressmaker. And when any of the dolls were sick, Betsey at once\ntook the part of old Dr. Betson, and talked gruffly with them about\ntonics and pills.\n\nShe talked for each of the dolls, too, and if you had listened in the\nnext room, you would have said that at least three or four people were\ntalking.\n\nBetsey really was such a very skilful little carpenter and seamstress,\nthat you will find only five pieces of furniture in the pictures that\nshe did not make all alone by herself. See if you can find the five\nthings. She even made Dinah, the colored cook.\n\nBetsey always liked School-time, and Bed-time. And she was a very good\nlittle girl about Errand-time and Dusting-time,\u2014considering everything.\n\nBut, do you know, I really think that most of her best lessons in\npatience and neatness were learned in Play-time!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter I: THE NEW HOUSE\n\n\nMother paused on her way past the playroom door, and listened. She knew\nBetsey did not have company, and yet there was a sound of three\nvoices,\u2014first a pleasant deep, bass voice, and then a pleasant silvery\nlittle voice, and then a pleasant low bark. Mother pushed open the door\nvery softly and looked in.\n\nThere lay Betsey on the great fur rug, with her curly head propped up on\nher hand. Before her stood the low, broad Morris chair, divided into two\nrooms. Mother knew it must be a bedroom at the back, on account of the\nfunny bed made of a box-cover, and covered with a gay patchwork quilt,\nBetsey\u2019s very first piece of sewing. And nobody could possibly mistake\nthe dining-room in front, with its large red pasteboard table, and\nlittle Mrs. Delight at one end, and her cute little husband at the\nother. Black Dinah stood by the table, smiling as usual, ready to serve\na large platter of salad, and Dumpling Delight barked gruffly once in a\nwhile, because there were so many tantalizing smells in the air.\n\n\u201cWill you have a breaded chop, my dear?\u201d asked Mr. Delight.\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, William. Will you have some of the creamed oysters?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd some of dis yeah lobster salad?\u201d inquired Dinah.\n\n(\u201cMercy,\u201d thought Mother, behind the door, \u201cwhat a dinner!\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I wish,\u201d said Mr. Delight with a deep cough, \u201cI\nwish we could invite your sister Prudence and her husband to spend a\nweek with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere in name hebben would you put comp\u2019ny, now, Massa Willyum? I ask\nyou dat,\u201d demanded Dinah.\n\n\u201cYes, William!\u201d echoed Mrs. Delight. \u201cThis house is certainly a tight\nfit for three, and with two extra ones!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could afford a larger house,\u201d said Mr. Delight in a worried\ntone.\n\n\u201cMy dear husband!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight. Betsey had to sit up straight\non the rug and take Mrs. Delight around the table to kiss her husband\naffectionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word I said, William; I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, there, my dear, I know you didn\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Delight\nsoothingly.\n\nBut Mother suspected that Mr. Delight was worried just the same, so she\nsoftly pulled the door together and tiptoed away to the telephone. She\nsmiled to herself as she called up the carpenter-shop.\n\n\u201cI want you to make my daughter Betsey a doll-house, Mr. Jones,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cJust like the one you made for your little girl,\u2014that had four\nrooms and six windows, and a big door between the rooms. And can you\nget it done for Betsey\u2019s birthday? In four days?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get it done, paint and all,\u201d promised Mr. Jones. And he did.\n\nOn the morning of her ninth birthday, Betsey came smiling to breakfast,\nexpecting to see a pile of dainty white parcels at her plate.\n\n\u201cYour birthday present is up in the playroom, Betsey dear,\u201d said Mother\nwith a kiss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d said Father.\n\nNow, whenever Father said that,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t like it,\u201d\u2014Betsey\u2019s\npresent was sure to be very large and wonderful. Once it had been her\nshiny bicycle, once her new blue playroom, and once her darling black\npony. So Betsey finished her breakfast in great excitement, hurried\nupstairs to the playroom and pushed open the door. And there it stood in\nthe center of the room,\u2014the dear little house, painted snow-white inside\nand pale green outside,\u2014with four rooms and six windows and tiny\nwindow-sashes, and the cunningest threshold!\n\nBetsey rushed over to the dainty little cottage, put her head in the\nlittle dining-room and looked through the double doors into the\ndrawing-room. \u201cJust to see how it would seem to live here,\u201d she thought.\n\nAnd then her eyes fell on a square white card dangling from one of the\nlittle window-sashes.\n\n\u201cTHE HOUSE OF DELIGHT\u201d said the card. \u201cTo Betsey, from Father and\nMother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say thank you before I begin to play,\u201d decided Betsey, tossing\nback her curls and clattering down-stairs at a great rate.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s that child!\u201d exclaimed Father. \u201cI was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like\nit!\u201d\n\n\u201cO but she does!\u201d shouted Betsey, whirling around in the middle of the\nroom. \u201cMr. Delight has wanted to move for the longest while!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mother,\u201d said Father with a twinkle, \u201cif we excuse\nBetsey today from doing any hard work?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey can simply make her bed,\u201d agreed Mother.\n\nSo Betsey whisked the white covers over her little brass bed as smoothly\nas she could (with a perfectly new doll-house waiting), and hurried back\nto the House of Delight.\n\nLittle Mr. Delight was sitting in his law office behind the radiator.\n\nBetsey picked him up, put on his gray derby hat, and walked him rapidly\nacross the room to the Morris chair.\n\n\u201cEdith, O Edith!\u201d he cried excitedly. \u201cMy salary has been raised to a\nmillion dollars a year! Now we can move into a new house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow perfectly lovely!\u201d cried Mrs. Delight. \u201cCan\u2019t we buy one directly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly can, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Delight. \u201cWe will go down right\naway and see Mr. Betts, the carpenter, and see what houses he has on\nhand for sale.\u201d\n\nBetsey slipped off the excited little gentleman\u2019s business coat and put\non his black one with the long tails, thrust his cane under his arm, and\npropped him up against the chair-back to wait for Mrs. Delight, who was\nmuch slower in dressing. Betsey selected a white silk blouse and\ntailored skirt for Mrs. Delight, and opened her gay Japanese parasol.\n\nThen, while the happy dolls were taking the trolley ride to Mr. Betts\u2019\ncarpenter-shop\u2014(really standing stiffly all the time against the\nchair-back)\u2014Betsey hustled the untidy shop into order. Then she drew\nthe table over to the window, settled her fat tube of paste, her bottle\nof glue, her scissors and scraps of satin on it, and sat down before it,\nvery importantly, as Mr. Betts, the carpenter. And what a smiling\ncarpenter she was!\n\n\u201cGood day, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight (quite out of breath with the\nstairs), \u201cwe want to buy a new house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a house?\u201d asked Mr. Betts thoughtfully, setting his little\ncustomers up against a pile of books.\n\n\u201cA moderately large house, Mr. Betts,\u201d replied Mr. Delight, \u201cthat is\nwell-built,\u2014for myself, my wife, and a colored cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts. \u201cI have the very house!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we take a look at it, my dear?\u201d said Mr. Delight, offering his\narm to his wife. And presently they stood in Mr. Betts\u2019 brand new house,\nthat was painted snow-white inside and pale green outside, that was\nwell-built and just right for three people.\n\n\u201cO what a lovely house!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Delight.\n\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d asked Mr. Delight, taking out his check-book.\n\n\u201cIt is $15,000, but it is very well-built and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is quite satisfactory to me, Mr. Betts,\u201d said Mr. Delight, calmly\nwriting his check for $15,000.\n\n\u201cAnd you can supply us with furniture, I suppose?\u201d asked Mr. Delight,\npassing the check to the obliging carpenter.\n\n\u201cEverything from a rocking-chair to a telephone,\u201d said Mr. Betts\nhappily.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cHere is a present from Aunty, for your birthday,\u201d said Mother when\nBetsey opened the door.\n\nBetsey sat right down on the stairs, smoothed out the long, pink ribbon\ncarefully (for she was sure to need it when she became Madame Bettina,\nthe French dressmaker), and shook out her present. It was a tiny\nsideboard with shelves for Mrs. Delight\u2019s china, with fascinating doors\nthat opened and shut, each set with a little silver-colored knob.\n\n\u201cO for my new house!\u201d cried Betsey. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the luckiest thing,\nMother, for I\u2019m afraid Mr. Betts doesn\u2019t keep sideboards!\u201d\n\nMother laughed and waved her hand at the happy little figure.\n\n\u201cNow, as long as the house is decided upon,\u201d said Mr. Betts cheerfully,\ntaking one of the little millionaires in each hand, and sitting down at\nhis work-table, \u201cI suppose the next thing is furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want everything,\u201d declared Mr. Delight recklessly. \u201cWe want a piano,\nand a window-seat, and a sideboard\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a sideboard that came in this morning,\u201d interrupted Mr. Betts,\nrolling it out directly.\n\n\u201cO isn\u2019t it sweet?\u201d said Mrs. Delight, clasping her hands. \u201cDinah and I\nwill paper the shelves with that scalloped paper that comes on purpose.\n\nThink of it, William, full of our wedding china!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetsey! O Betsey!\u201d called Tom, plunging up the stairs. \u201cSee what I\u2019ve\ngot.\u201d\n\nBetsey turned around and examined with interest a piece of gilt molding\nabout six inches long that Tom held out.\n\n\u201cSee, lay it on this side, and presto! it\u2019s a sofa! You can have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Tom, how kind of you! I\u2019ll make a huckaback pillow for it,\u2014pink and\ngreen. It will be too dear for anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d thought Tom on his way down-stairs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be so\nawfully pleased with a little thing like that. Maybe I could saw her out\na little chair on my jig-saw\u2014I wonder?\u201d\n\nAnd in a few minutes there was a strange, buzzing sound down cellar,\nthat kept time to the hum of Madame Bettina\u2019s tiny sewing-machine\nupstairs. For it was Madame Bettina that had to make the sheets and\npillow-cases and net curtains, and all the things which are hardly in a\ncarpenter\u2019s line.\n\n\u201cHow can I make a telephone?\u201d puzzled Betsey. And she gazed\nthoughtfully at her box of beads.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Betts suddenly, taking two large silver beads from\nhis box.\n\n\u201cHo-ho!\u201d he laughed, rummaging excitedly in the closet where he kept his\nsmooth pieces of kindling wood.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Delight,\u201d he remarked calmly, \u201cI will personally see to it\nthat the telephone is put in the very first thing, so you won\u2019t lose an\nimportant call.\u201d He began to paint a small piece of wood a rich, deep\nbrown, with water colors.\n\n\u201cAnother small piece of wood for a battery box,\u201d murmured Betsey,\nwhanging away at an obstinate nail. \u201cThe two silver beads for bells, a\ntwo-pointed tack to hold the receiver\u2014a green cord\u2014a roll of black paper\nstuck into a black bead for a receiver\u2014. Now, what on earth for a\nspeaking tube?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of tubes! Mr. Betts triumphantly took the cap from his tube of\npaste, and with one resounding rap of his hammer, nailed it securely in\nthe exact center of the new telephone!\n\n\u201cHullo, up there!\u201d called a deep voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome up, come up!\u201d called Betsey, running to open the door for her\nfather. \u201cSee the telephone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, quite a telephone, indeed!\u201d said Father admiringly. \u201cNow, what\ncan you do with this?\u201d He laid a polished wooden stamp-box in her hand.\n\nBetsey thought a moment. \u201cA clock. Glue the cover down, paint a lace,\nstick on a pendulum\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd hang it on the wall!\u201d finished Father. And he smiled over his\nshoulder to see Betsey change so suddenly into Mr. Betts, who must\nsomehow sell to Mr. Delight a Grandfather\u2019s clock,\u2014solid oak, keeping\nperfect time, and extremely reasonable in price.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in your new house at once, or wait until everything\nis done?\u201d asked Mr. Betts.\n\n\u201cO live there at once, William!\u201d pleaded Mrs. Delight. \u201cI am just crazy\nto hang the curtains!\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d said Mr. Delight. \u201cYou get Dinah to come over to help you, and I\nwill superintend Mr. Betts and his moving men.\u201d\n\nSoon the tiny drawing-room was in great confusion. Dinah and her\nmistress sat among great piles of net and lace, running the dainty\ncurtains on their poles, tying them back with wide rose-colored ribbons,\nand getting up and down on the step-ladder to arrange the folds.\n\nSuddenly, as Betsey swung Mrs. Delight gently from the little ladder, a\ntiny elastic between Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms snapped, and down fell her\nround right arm on the soft new carpet!\n\n\u201cMassa Willyum!\u201d shrieked Dinah. \u201cMiss Edith done broke her arm\na-falling off dis yeah step-ladder! Telephone for de doctor, wid de new\ntelephone!\u201d\n\nMr. Delight rushed distractedly to the telephone. \u201cDr. Betson, please\ncome immediately! Yes, my wife has broken her arm. It\u2019s very serious\nindeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come just as soon as my motor can get there,\u201d replied Dr.\nBetson.\n\nDinah was wringing her hands and crying when Mr. Delight hurried into\nthe drawing-room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel so badly, Dinah,\u201d said Mrs. Delight bravely. \u201cDr. Betson is\nthe best surgeon in the world.\u201d And as she smiled a little, Dr. Betson\nrang the bell violently.\n\n\u201cWell, well!\u201d he said heartily, kneeling down to examine the break.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Delight, because I can fix this arm in a trice! Just\nspread a few blankets on the floor for a comfortable bed and I\u2019ll go to\nwork.\u201d\n\nBetsey pulled a piece of new elastic (kept for just this purpose) out of\nher work-box, threaded Mrs. Delight\u2019s arms on, and tied them tight. And\nthen to make her work look quite professional, she bandaged the right\narm beautifully with cheese cloth.\n\n\u201cIs it possible the arm is set?\u201d asked Mrs. Delight as the doctor put up\nhis instruments (a ribbon-runner and a pair of blunt scissors).\n\n\u201cAll done, Madam,\u201d declared Dr. Betson. \u201cThis is a very fortunate kind\nof break. Now that it is properly set, you do not even need to be\ncareful. I would suggest that you take a good rest, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed she will!\u201d agreed Mr. Delight shaking hands with the gruff\ndoctor. He was still quite pale. \u201cNow, as soon as I can move Mrs.\nDelights bed up to her room, we will all go to bed, for we are very much\nexhausted with moving.\u201d\n\nBetsey carefully slipped on Mrs. Delight\u2019s long, lacy night-dress, and\ntucked her in gently, and soon she was asleep.\n\nAnd soon Mr. Delight left Dumpling asleep, and tiptoed up to bed, and\nsoon he was asleep. As for Dinah, she was asleep in two minutes. So\nthe tall, shiny clock on the wall ticked through the night alone, for\nBetsey crept happily into her own white bed, and fell asleep herself,\nfor she had worked hardest of all!\n\n\nCHAPTER: Chapter II - AT THE SEASHORE\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you making, Betsey?\u201d asked Tom, one hot July day.\n\n\u201cA cottage,\u201d said Betsey.\n\n\u201cWhew! There\u2019s nothing small about you! What do you want of a cottage\nwhen you\u2019ve got a new doll-house?\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Delight has to have a summer home, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d answered Betsey\nwith dignity. \u201cO Tom, dear! Could I borrow your train of cars? The\nDelights want to go to the seashore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have it. I don\u2019t want it any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cO thank you, Tom. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d want to lend that little\nsuit-case\u2014that Uncle John gave you full of candy, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Tom, solemnly making a great bow, \u201cyou may have, too. What\ndo I want of a doll\u2019s suit-case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an old dear,\u201d said Betsey affectionately. \u201cNow let me think what\nelse I need to make before the families can start for the beach.\u201d She\ncut a large window in her pasteboard cottage as she spoke.\n\n\u201cHow many families are going?\u201d inquired Tom politely.\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d said Betsey, carefully marking her window-sashes. \u201cMr. and Mrs.\nDelight, and Dinah and Dumpling, for one family, and Mr. and Mrs.\nDarling for the other. Try to think, Tom, what I ought to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre your families going swimming?\u201d asked Tom.\n\n\u201cO yes, indeed, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that you make bathing-suits.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! How stupid of me! Here I am, planning too much about trains\nand cottages, and not at all about clothes!\u201d\n\nAnd Tom went down-stairs, just as Mr. Betts, the carpenter, finished his\ncottage, and changed into Madame Bettina, the French dressmaker.\n\n\u201cO Madame Bettina!\u201d said Mrs. Delight all out of breath. \u201cWe want some\nbathing-suits made. We\u2019re going to the seashore!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is ver\u2019 good,\u201d said Betsey, with Madame Bettina\u2019s French accent\n(just as Mother\u2019s dressmaker talked). \u201cWill you have Alice-blue suits\ntrimmed with white braid, with charming bath caps to match?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds very pretty,\u201d agreed Mrs. Delight. \u201cMy sister doesn\u2019t know\nyet that she\u2019s going, so hers is a great surprise. Make hers blue and\nmine black, so we can tell them apart, and Dinah must have one too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall send them tonight, surely,\u201d said Madame Bettina, getting to\nwork in good earnest, for it is not every dressmaker that can make five\nbathing-suits in one day. She cut here and snipped there, and ran her\nmachine at a great rate.\n\n\u201cBetsey!\u201d called Mother above all the noise. \u201cCome to the head of the\nstairs a minute.\u201d\n\nBetsey stopped her noise obediently and opened the door.\n\n\u201cTom and I are going to Boston at ten o\u2019clock. Norah will take care of\nyou. And you can ask Mary to come over to play this afternoon, if you\nwant to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need Mary, Mother!\u201d cried Betsey laughing. \u201cYou see with Mrs.\nDelight\u2019s company I have my hands full already.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mother laughing too. \u201cNow what do you want me to bring\nyou? I\u2019m going to take your gold thimble in to be straightened where the\nchair rocked on it.\u201d She held up the tiny blue box.\n\n\u201cO Mother dear! If you\u2019ll only take the thimble in something else, and\ngive me that thimble box, you don\u2019t have to bring me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d asked Mother in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cA camera. It\u2019s just the size. I\u2019ll cover it with black oilcloth and\nmake a little, black carrying case just to fit, and Mrs. Delight can\ntake it to the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is your camera, then,\u201d laughed Mother, tossing it up the stairs\ninto Betsey\u2019s two hands.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d sang Betsey, bustling back into the playroom.\n\n\u201cDing-ling!"
