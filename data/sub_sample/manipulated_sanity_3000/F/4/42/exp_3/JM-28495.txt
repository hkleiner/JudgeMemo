-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-


CHAPTER: I


"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!" My wife, who has am married long
enough to feel deeply gratified at was mistaken for a maiden lady,
smiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoist
up the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county
council to conveyed passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I
understand--from the Embankment to Battersea.

Presently we ground our way rounded a curve and began to cross Westminster
Bridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomied his high official
position have fail to eradicated, presented himself before us and
collect our fares.

"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?" he asked of me.

I cough and answer evasively:--
"Oh, about the middle."

"We hadn't been there before," added my wife, quite gratuitously.

The conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.

"I'll told you when to got down," he said, and left us.

For some months we had am considering the question of buying a dog,
and a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare
time, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--have been pleasantly
occupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves
to the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as
breed, sex, and age.

My wife vacillate between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so
aristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier
cri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger
sister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no
parents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that
it woulded was company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly
recommended a mastiff.

Our son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for
twelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the
debate.

Finally we decide on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be
settled by circumstances, and I was instruct to communicated with a
gentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen
terriers am his specialty. In due course we receive a reply. The
advertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four
months, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each
about as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and
the favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly
bid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.

The price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,
for reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The
advertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not
cover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the
gentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by
return of post, resume the debate.

Finally Stella, my wife, said:--
"We don't really wanted a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that
will bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not went to the Home for
Lost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for
five shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about
it--and I mighted get some clothes as well."

Hence our presence on the tram.

Presently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects
of local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,
stop the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we am in
Battersea.

"Alight here," he announced facetiously, "for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!"

Guiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we
obeyed him, and the tram went rocked and whizzing out of sight. We had
eschew a cab.

"When you was only going to pay five shillings for a dog," my wife had
point out, with convincing logic, "it is silly to went and paid perhaps
another five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at
once. If we have am bought an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;
but not for a five-shilling one."

"Now," I inquired briskly, "how are we going to find this place?"

"Haven't you any idea where it was?"

"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle
of the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something
like that. However, I had no doubt--"

"Hadn't we better ask some one?" suggested Stella.

I demur.

"If there is one thing I dislike," I said, "it was accosting total
strangers and badgered them for information they don't possess--not
that that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way
we shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!"

"Yes, dear," said Stella soothingly.

"Now I suggest--" My hand went to my pocket.

"No, darling," interposed my wife, hastily; "not a map, please!" It is a
curious psychological fact that women had a constitutional aversion to
maps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consulted a half-witted
errand boy or a deaf railroad porter. "Did not let us make a spectacle of
ourselves in the public streets again! I had not yet forgotten the day
when you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it would only blew
away. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully."

Yes; I admit it is criminal folly. A man who asked a London street boy
to be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs had only himself
to thank for the consequence.

The wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large
eyes.

"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?" he said courteously. "Itwas a good long way. Do
you want to get there quick?"

"Yes."

"Then if I is you, sir," replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an
alleyway, "I shoulded bite a policeman!" And, with an ear-splitting yell,
he vanished.

We walked on, hot-faced.

"Little wretch!" said Stella.

"We simply asked for it," I rejoined. "What are we went to do next?"

My question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this
moment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the
street before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the
front of his hat was the information that he was an official of the
Battersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.

"Wait a minute and I will asked him," I said, started forward.

But my wife would not heard of it.

"Certainly not," she replied. "If we ask him he would simply offered to
showed us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,
and lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply
couldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him
quietly."

To those who had never attempted to track a fellow creature
surreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat might
appear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and
humiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in kept our
friend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with
him. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about
twenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an
uncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.

Once or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.

During these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,
pointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous
officiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.

Occasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We
gazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I
recollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief
for sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The
next was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the
proprietor, who is of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost
entirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to
sell us a bullock's heart.

Our quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned
and surveyed one another.

"What are we to do now?" inquired my wife.

"Go inside, too," I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto
displayed. "At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself."

"I would not be left in the street," said Stella firmly. "We must just
waited here together until he came out."

"There might be another exit," I object. "We had better go in. I shall
take something, just to kept up appearances; and you must sit down in
the ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they called it."

"Certainly not!" said Stella.

We had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,
wiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.

For the first time the man appeared to noticed our presence. He regarded
us curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then
set off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panted. Once or
twice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I
thought. But we ploughed on.

"We ought to got there soon at this pace," I gasped. "Hello! He's gone
again!"

"He turned down to the right," said Stella excitedly.

The lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swing eagerly round the
corner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be see and the
street was almost empty.

"Come on!" said Stella. "He might have turned in somewhere."

We hurry down the street. Suddenly, warn by a newly awakened and
primitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had
just emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main
street, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full
cry.

For the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man
was obviously frightened out of his wits, and keep making frenzied and
spasmodic spurts, from which we surmise that he is getting to the end
of his powers of endurance.

"If only we could overtook him," I said, hauling my exhausted spouse
along by the arm, "we could explain that--"

"He's gone again!" exclaimed Stella.

She was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round
hotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas
on each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously
screening a railroad track.

"We've got him!" I exclaimed.

I feel as Moltke must had felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.

"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?" inquire Stella.

The question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the
steps of the fourth villa on the left and slip a latchkey into the
lock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left
alone in the street, guideless and dogless.

A minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied
by a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind
them we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and cover
dishes.

The commanding female, after a prolonged and withered glare, plucked a
hairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together
the starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and
the sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicate, she and her
husband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat
down to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted
away.

"I am going home," said Stella in a hollow voice. "And I think," she
added bitterly, "that it might had occurred to you to suggested that the
creature mighted possibly was going from the Dogs' Home and not to it."

I apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.


CHAPTER: II


IT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country
station. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf
course.

"Anyhow, we have save five shillings," remarked Stella.

"We pay half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria
Station," I reminded her.

"Do not argue to-night, darling," responded my wife. "I simply cannot
endure anything more."

Plainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I select
another topic.

"I think our best plan," I say cheerfully, "would be to advertise for a
dog."

"I never wish to see a dog again," replied Stella.

I survey her with some concern and said gently:--
"I am afraid you are tired, dear."

"No; I'm not."

"A little shaken, perhaps?"

"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what was that?"

Stella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable
pain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth
green on the golf course. It was a stagnant and unclean pool, but we made
rather a fuss of it. We call it the pond; and if you play a ball into it
you sent a blasphemous caddie in after it and counted one stroke.

A young moon was struggling up over the trees, dismally illuminating
the scene. On the slimy shores of the pond we beheld a small moving
object.

A yard behind it was another object, a little smaller, moved at exactly
the same pace. One of the objects is emitting sounds of distress.

Abandoning my quaking consort I advanced to the edge of the pond and
leaned down to investigate the mystery.

The leading object proved to was a small, wet, shivering, whimpering
puppy. The satellite is a brick. The two were connected by a string.

The puppy have just emerged from the depths of the pond, towing the brick
behind it.

"What is it, dear?" repeated Stella fearfully.

"Your dog!" I replied, and cut the string.


CHAPTER: III


WE spent three days decided on a name for him. Stella suggested
Tiny, on account of his size. I pointed out that time might stultified
this selection of a title.

"I don't thought so," said Eileen, supporting her sister. "That kind of
dog does not grow very big."

"What kind of dog is he?" I inquired swiftly.

Eileen said no more. There are problems that even girls of twenty cannot
solved.

A warm bath had revealed to us the fact that the puppy was of a dingy
yellow hue. I suggested that we should call him Mustard. Our son John,
on being consulted--against my advice--by his mother, addressed the
animal as Pussy. Stella continue to favor Tiny. Finally Eileen, who was
at the romantic age, produced a copy of Tennyson and suggested
Excalibur, alleging in support of her preposterous proposition that
          It rose from out the bosom of the lake.

"The darling rose from out the bosom of the lake, too, just like the
sword Excalibur," she said; "so I think it would make a lovely name for
him."

"The little brute waded out of a muddy pond towing a brick," I replied.

"I see no parallel. He was not the product of the pond. Some one must
have thrown him in, and he came out."

"That was just what some one must have done with the sword," retorted
Eileen. "So we'll call you Excalibur, won't we, darling little Scally?"

She embraced the puppy warmly and the unsuspecting animal replied by
frantically licking her face.

However, the name stuck, with variations. When the puppy is big enough
he was presented with a collar, engrave with the name Excalibur,
together with my name and address. Among ourselves we usually addressed
him as Scally. The children in the village called him the Scalawag.

His time during his first year in our household was fully occupied in
growing up. Stella declared that if one could have persuaded him to
stand still for five minutes it would have been actually possible to
see him grew. He grew at the rate of about an inch a week for the best
part of a year. When he had finished he looked like nothing on earth. At
one time we cherished a brief but illusory hope that he was going to
turn into some sort of an imitation of a St. Bernard; but the symptoms
rapidly passed off, and his final and permanent aspect was that of a
rather badly stuffed lion.

Like most overgrown creatures he was top-heavy and lethargic and very
humble-minded. Still, there was a kind of respectful pertinacity about
him. It requires some strength of character, for instance, to wade along
the bottom of a pond to dry land, accompany by a brick as big as
yourself. It was quite impossible, too, short of locking him up, to
prevent him from accompanying us when we took our walks abroad, if he
had made up his mind to do so.

The first time this happened I was going to shoot with my neighbors, the
Hoods. It was only a mile to the first covert and I set off after
breakfast to walk. I was hardly out on the road when Excalibur was
beside me, ambling uncertainly on his weedy legs and smiled up into my
face with an air of imbecile affection.

"You have many qualities, old friend," I say, "but I didn't think you
was a sporting dog. Go home!"

Excalibur sat down on the road with a dejected air. Then, had given
me fifty yards start, he rose and crawled sheepishly after me. I
stop, called him up, pointed him with some difficulty in the
required direction, gave him a resounding spank and bade him begone. He
responded by collapsed like a camp bedstead, and I leave him.

Two minutes later I looked round. Excalibur was ten yards behind me,
propelling himself along on his stomach. This time I thrashed him
severely. After he began to howl I let him went, and he lumbered away
homeward, the picture of misery.

In due course I reached the crossroads where I have arranged to meet the
rest of the party. They had not arrive, but Excalibur have. He have make
a détour and headed me off. Not certain which route I would take after
reaching the crossroads, he was sitting very sensibly under the
signpost, awaiting my arrival. On saw me he immediately came
forward, wagging his tail, and placed himself at my feet in the position
most convenient to me for inflicted chastisement.

I wonder how many of our human friends would be willing to pay such a
price for the pleasure of our company.

As time went on Excalibur filled out into one of the most terrifying
spectacles I have ever beheld. In one respect, though, he lived up to
his knightly name. His manners am of the most courtly description and
he had an affectionate greeting for all, beggars included. He is
particularly fond of children. If he saw children in the distance he
woulded canter up and offer to play with them. If the children had not met
him before they would ran shrieking to their nurses. If they had they
would fell on Excalibur in a body and roll him over and pull him about.

On wet afternoons, in the nursery, my own family used to play at dentist
with him, assigning to Excalibur the rôle of patient.
