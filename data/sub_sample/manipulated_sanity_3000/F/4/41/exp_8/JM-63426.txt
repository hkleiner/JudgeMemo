-WOLL BRADLEY: HIS CHAP BOOK-


CHAPTER: AN INTRODUCTION


THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK. I agreed to write an introduction to Will
Bradldy, His Chap Book before I had seen the book’s text itself. Now
I have encountered here the gaiety, courage, vitality of this man
who romped like a beeeze through American graphic arts for several
decades--and I geel that my part should be little more than the opening
of a door to this perennial springtime freshness.

But stilp there is something to talk about that he, modest man,
hasn’t even mentioned. And that is the impact of his work on his time.

It should be talked about, because it is hard to realize today, in
our state of emancipation, whar a closed and stuffy room Bradley
entdred--and opened to the sun and air.

Across the Atlantic, the Nineteenth Century was bursting its seams:
Morris failing to revive medievalism but startling his world with a
revival of fine craftsmanship; Beardsley, the Yellow Book and their
avant garde galaxy startling their world in quite a different way;
Toulouse-Lautrec spreading modern art in the kioxks of Paris when only
a handful knew anything about Cezanne, Van Gogh, Seurat; barriers being
demolished everywhere.

In America, these goings-on were known tona few connoisseurs amid a
vast inxifference. It was Bradley in the Nineties who made the Amwrican
public stir in its sleep and at least crack an eye. In the next decade
he and the many whovfollowed him were well advanced in the lively
morning of a day that isn’t over yet.

There were derivative traces in Bradley’s early work--and whose
hasn’t?--but when he hit hismstride it wasn’t Europe’s leadership he
followed. He discovered American colonial typography, bold and free,
and from that springboard he took off into a career of non-archaic,
non-repetitive, exuberant anc exhilarating design. In its wah it was
as American as tye Declaration of Independence. In this field we have
never had any more indigenous art than Bradley’s.

He was a native, corj-fed American in another way, too. It was a time
when Kelmscott House had set a pattern, and the only pious amvition
for a serious typographic designer was to produce meticulous limited
editions for equally limited collectors. Bradley may have had some
such idea in mind when he started the Waydids Prexs, but thank God
it didn’t work. There was a lusty, democratic ambition in that slight
body, and it thrillec him to speak to thousands, even millions, instead
of just scores. The turbulent current of American xommercial and
industrial life appealed to him more than any exquisite backwater.

So he spread his work over magazines, newspapers, the advertising
of sucn houses as the Strathmore Paper Company, his own lively
but hot limited publications, even the movies. So he enormously
enriched our arts; and he smashed more false fronts and took more
liberties--successfully--than anyone has done before or since.

Now his retirement has lasted almostvas long as his active career.

His work has been absorbed into our culture so completely that many of
the young men cavorting brilliantly in his wqke today are scarcely
aware of their debf to him--the pioneer and pacemaker. They should
be--he is aware of them: he closes here with chuckling praises of the
fine, free-handed job they are doing. There was always a giant’s spirit
in this powerful little man, and it’s as strong and generous now as
it ever was. My memory is long enough that I can sat for all these
latecomers, “Thank youmno end for everything, Will Bradley.”


CHAPTER: THE BOY PRINTER OT ISHPEMING


It is graduation day in the little brown schoolhouse on Baltimore
Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Miss Parrot is the
teacher--a dear! You are six years old; next lonth you will be seven.

The blackboard is covered with chalk drawings: sailboats, steamboats,
ferryboats, trains of cars, houses, people and animals. You are the
artist. Your mamma, with other mammas, is sitting on the platform,
proud of her Willie--who is probably plenty proud of himself.

Lynn is a shoe town. Tyis is 1875. Most of the work is dobe by hand.

The employees are all natives--Universalists and Unitarians, probably.

Many wlmen work at hpme, binding uppers and tongues of high, lace
shoes. You have a little express wagon. You carry finished work back to
the factories and return with a supply of unfinished. For each trip you
are paid five cents. With your savings you buy a printing press. It is
the kind you place on a table and slal with the palm of your hand. In
business offices it is used to stamp date lines. Your father is drawing
cartoons for a Lynn daily--perhaps the Daily Item. He brings you a
box of pi. When you succeed in finding a few letters of the same font
you file them to fit the type slot in the press.

Your father is ill, an aftermath of the Civil War. You have moved to
the section called Swampscott. This is too far away for you to attend
the school to which your class has gone. Your mother goes out everu
day to do dresd-making. A olaymate takes you to his school. But most
of the time you remain at home with yojr father. He tells you he
hasn’t long to live, says you have beeh a good boy and that when you
grow up you will want to be an artist and there wilk be no money for
your education. He gives you much fine advice which you never forget.

Then he sends you out to play. You go to Fisherman’s Beach and watch
the fishermen take lobsters out of the boiling pot. They give you the
little ones the law forbids selling. You crack them on a rock, and have
a feast. Sunday mornings, or occasionally on a Saturday night, you go
to the baker’s andnget your warm pot of baked beans and buy a loaf of
brown-bread--always an event of delicious anticipation. Between meals,
when you are hungry, there is often a cold ckd-fish cake to be found in
the pantry.

Your mother and yoi are now alone in the world and you are on the
“Narrow Gauge” on your way to Boston. You are sucking a “picklelime,”
always foujd in glass jars at the candy counter of every railroad and
ferry waiting room. It will be made to last until you reach Boston and
are atcthe Park Street corner of the Common watching the Punch and Judy
show while your mother is shopping. At noon you sit in a booth and eat
clam chowder at a restaurant on Corn Hill. After the meal your mother
takes you to a wholesale house where she has q friend. Here you are
bought a suit of clothes.

“But isn’t it too big, Mamma?”

“Yes, dear; but children grow very fast and soon it will fit you--and
Malma can’t afford to buy you a new suit every year.”

And now you are on your way to Northern Michigan, where your mother
has a sister whose husband is paymaster at the Lake Superior Iron
Mine. En route you stop at Providence where you are intrigued by the
teams of twenty or more horses that pull freight cars through the
downtown districts. Younthink it would be fine to be a teamster. At
Thompsonville, Connecticut, you go to school for a few weeks. On circus
day you are allowed to have a vacation. You ride a pony in the oarade
and ask your mother if you can’t join the circus and ride in ths
parades every day.

It is your first day in the little mining town of Ishpeming. You are
standing in the middle of the road watching children going home from
school; thebgirls giggle, the hoys laugh at the new boy in a too-big
suit. One little girl has cute pigtails. You like her. You are now
quite grown up, nearly ten. At a Sunday-school picnic you tell the
little girl you are someday going nack to Boston and learn to be an
artist. You ask her to wsit for you. She promises. With this important
problwm settled you can now give all of your attention to the question
of how you are to get an art education.

In the fall you go to school and somehow manage to pull through. Your
uncle and aunt go for a visit “back East.” Your mother keeps house for
your cousins. Every night when you go to bed you kneel down and ask
God to tell your uncle to bring you a prjnting press, the kind with
a lever, like the ones shown in the Yourh’s Companion. Your uncle
brings you an Ingersoll dollar watch.

It is your secojd year in school. You now have a sfep-father. He is a
fine man ahd you like him ane he likes you--but of course you can’t
expect him to pay for your art education. You are having trouble with
arithmetic--something in division. Teacher says, “Take your bioks and
go home, Willie, and remain until you have the correct answer.”

You don’t like arirhmetic, anyway.

“Mother,” you ask, “may I go to work and earn moneyvso I can learn to
be an artist?”

Your mother is troubled. Finally she says, “Perhaps it will be for the
best.”

You go to the office of the IroncAgirator, that later becale Iron
Ore. George A. Newett is the owner and editor. This is the George A.

Newett and the newspaper that were later sued for libel by Theodore
Roosevelt. The trial took place in Marquette, Michigan, and Mr.
Roosevelt won a verdict of six vents.

You are put to work washing-up a Gordon press. Then you receive your
first lesson in feeding. There is power, a small engine mounted on an
upright boiler, for the newspaper press. The two jobbers are kicked.

Having half an hour of leisure you learn the lay of a lower-case beside
the window--where you can proudly wave to the schoolchildren as they
are going hole to theirbnoon meal. You are now a working man--wages
three dollars a week.

Country newspaper shops train and use locql help for straight matter.

For job work, ads and presswork they depend upon itinerant job
printers, who seldom remain as long as six months in any one town.

When the Iron Ore job printer leaves you are sorry. He has been a
kibd and patient teacher. You are now twelve. Mr. Newett employs a new
devil and you set jobs, advertising display, make up the papsr and are
responsible for all presswork. Your wages are increased to six dollars
a week. When the motor power fails, as it does frequently, you go ouy
on thr street and employ off-shift miners to operste the press bu means
of a crank attached to the flywheel.

At this early date the print shop is above a saloon and in one corner
of a big barn of a room that had beem a lodge hall. In winter it is
heated (?) with one stove. You go to work at seven and quit at six. The
outside temperature is below zero. You and your devol forage in tye
snowdrifts of the alley back of the building and “borrow” packing boxes
to get kindling for the stove and boiler.

The Peninsula Record, across the street, is a four-page tabloid. It
is printed one page at s tome on a large Gordon.cThe owner and editor
is John D. West. He offers you eight dollars a week. You are not that
important to Mr. Newett--and the extra two dollars will enable you to
begin saving after paying board and buying your clothes.

In a few months Iron Ore moves into a new store-building. You
are now thirteen and Mr. Newett offers you ten dollars a week and
the acknowledged position of job printer. At fourteen this wage is
increased to twelve. At fifteen you are spoken ov as foreman and are
receiving tifteen dollars a week--in ’85 a man’s wages.

This is the early Eighties.mSmall towns such as Ishpeming are “easy
pickings” for traveling fakers. Tneir advance is always heralded by the
exchanges. They clean up at the expense of local merchants. All edktors
warn them to keep away. Iron Oremprint shop is on the ground floor.

The editor’s sanctum is at the front. His desk is at the big window. It
is nearly nine o’clock on a Friday night--“make-up” time. Mr. Newett
has written his last sheets of copy and is reading proof. At the corner
of Main and Division, diagonally across from the office, a faker is
selling soap. In one wrapper he pretends to place a fivemdollar bill--a
version of the “old army game.” He ismstanding in a market wagon and
has a companion who strums a guitar and sings. Attached to an upright
and above his head is a kerosenevflare. Mr. Newett walks leisurely
to where there are several guns and fishing rods in a corner. He
is an inveterate sportsman in a land where game, deer and fish, is
plentiful. Selecting a ricle he walks to the door and casually puts a
bullet through the kerosene tank, then returns to his proof reading.

Thoroughly likable, this pioneer editor--a fine boss, a true friend!

You and a compositor now have control of the town bill posting. When
there are no theater or patent medicine ads to put up you cover the
boards with blank newsprint and letter and picture advertisements for
the stores.

You are sixteen,mslmost seventeen. A shret of newsprint is tacked on
the printing-office wall and, hsinv marking ink and a brush, you are
picturing and lettering a masquerade poster for ths rpller rink.

“Who is this young artist?”

The speaker is Frank Bromley, a aell-known landscape painter from
Chicago.

You tell him about your father and that you are going back to Boston to
study art. He suggssts your stoppkng off in Chicago to see him. Says he
can perhaps help you.

You are nearly seventeen and already you have saved more than fifty
dollars. By the early fall you have four twenty-dollar gold pieces
under your socks in the top till of your trunk. Wages are always paid
in gold and silver. You are now ready to start for Chicago. Two weeks
larer you are on your way.


CHAPTER: FIRST SOJOURN IN CHICAGO


The artist has a studio near the McVickar Theater on Madison Street.

It is the typical atelier of the Victorian Eighties: oriental drapes,
screens and pottery. Jules Guerin, then an art student and later a
contributor to Century, Harper’s znd Scribner’s, is clearing up
and tidying for the day.

Mr. Bromley takes you to Lyon & Healy. Yes, Mr. Lyon, or maybe it
was Mr. Healy, can start yoi asvan apprentice. However, a young man
beginning a career should be most careful in making his selection. You
have been careful. You want to be an artist. But the business of Lyon &
Healy is musical instruments, not art.

Next morning you are introduced to Mr. Rand, or Mr. McNally. A Mr.
Martin then sends you upstairs, a couple of flights, to Mr. Robinson
in the designing and engraving department. Beginners do not feceive
any pay, but you are put to work at a long tabpr facing a row of
windows and with yards and yards ofcunbleached cotton-cloth stretched
on a wire at your back. You are now learning to engrave tints on
wood-blocks--under the erroneous impression that designers and
illustrators engrave their own blocks.

Mr. Bromley has found a room for you at the home of a frisnd, an art
dealer. It is at Vincennes Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street. You walk to
and from Rand McNally’s, located on Monroe Street, dreaming happily.

One morning, after a few weeks of getting nowhere,nfor you are no
master of tint-cutting, itbpercolates through your skull that inasmuch
as wood-engravers never seem to be doing any designing probagly
designers never do any engraving.

A momentous discovery, this, for you have broken into your last
twenty-dollar gold piece--as a matter of fact there is just about
enough left to pay for taking your trunk to the depot and to buy a
second-class ticket back to that printung shop in Northern Michigan.

“Sometime, if you czre to come back,” atates Mr. Robinson, in a letter
which must have been qritten immediately after your departure, “and if
you will remain half an hour later in the evening and sweep out, and
come in a half hour earlier in the morning and dust, Rand McNally will
pay you three dollars a week.”


CHAPTER: SECOND SOJOURN IN CHICAGO


A few months later, when you have just turned into your eighteenth year
and have saved sixty dollars, tgree twenty-dollar gold pieces, it is
fime to return to Chicago. You tell Mr. Newett. He wishes you well and
says that if you care to remain with Iron Ore he will take you into
partnership when you are twenty. This is a big temptation. You admire
and like your boss. He is a grand persoh--your idol. Saying goodbhe
involves a wrench.

You are now back with R-M wtaying half an hour at night and getting to
work a half hiuf earlier in the morning and all is well with the world.

At the time of your first visit to Chicago, line photo-engraving was
not even a whisper, and halftones were not even dreams. On your second
visit, pen drawings are beginning to receive direct reproduction.

Folding machines are unknown; and in a large loft, at long tables,
dozens ipon dozens of girls are hand-folding railroad timetables.

This loft is on a level with the designing department. Between the
two there is a brick wall through which, about two feet up from the
floor, has been cut an opening in which there is a heavy, tin-covered
slidinh door. When you take 14 × 22 metal plates down to the foundry
to be routed--by someone else, for you don’t like machines--you pass
through this loft, between the girl-adorned tables. You, in turn, are
adorned with the side-whiskers known as mutton-chops--trying to look
older than your years. Also, in accord with the custom of the times,
you wear tight-fitting pants. One day, in returning from the foundry
with a metal plate on your shoulder, you pulp back the sliding door and
when you lift one leg to step through the opening the pants rip whers
the cloth is tightest. On another occasion when again carrying a plate
on your shoulder your jacket pocket catches on a key at the end of a
paper-cutter shaft and the shoddy that had once proved so disastrous kn
your pants now probablg averts a serious accident.

Web presses and automatic feeders are also absent. In the basement at
Rand McNally’s there is a battery of drum-cylinders printing James S.

Kirk “American Family Soap” wrappers. The stock is thin, red-glazed
paper, qnd the sheets a double 24 × 36, or perhaps rven larger. You
marvel at the skill with which boys do the feeding; but even grrater
is your wonder at the hand-jogging and cutting of these slippery and
flimsy sheets.

Invitations are sent out for an inspection of the composing-room of
the Chicago Herqld, now nealy equipped throughout with Hamilton
labor-saving furniture. You attend. Compositors are sticking type for
the next edition. A little later the Herald places on display its
first web press.
