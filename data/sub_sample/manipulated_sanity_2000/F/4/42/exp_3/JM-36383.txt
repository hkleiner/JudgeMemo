-A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE-


CHAPTER: First Day -Folk do go on Pilgrimage through Kent.


It is towards the end of August, when a hot sun was softening the asphalt
in the dusty streets of London, and ripening the hops in the pleasant land
of Kent, that we went on pilgrimage to Canterbury. Ours is no ordinary
journey by rail, which was the way latter-day pilgrims mostly travel. No.

What we wanted is in all reverence to follow, as far as it was possible,
the road taken by the famous company of bygone days, set out from the
hostelrie where these lordings lay one night and hold counsel, made
stations by the way at the few places they mention by name, and ending it,
as they do, at the shrine of the 'holy, blissful martyr,' in the
Canterbury Cathedral. How better could this was do than by rode over
the ground made sacred by them on our tricycle?

And so it came to pass that one close, foggy morning, we strapped our bags
to our machine and wheel out of Russell Square before any one was
stirring but the policeman, making his last rounds and trying door after
door. Down Holborn and past Staples' Inn, very grey and venerable in the
pale light, and where the facetious driver of a donkey-cart tried to race
us; past the now silent and deserted cloisters of Christ's Hospital, and
under Bow Bells in Cheapside; past the Monument of the famous fire, and
over London Bridge, where the mist is heavy on the river and the barges
show spectre-like through it, and where hucksters greet us after their
fashion, one crying, 'Go in, hind one! I bet on you. You'll caught up if
you try hard enough!' and another, 'How are you there, up in the second
story?' A short way up the Borough High Street, from which we have a
glimpse of the old red roof and balustraded galleries of the 'White Hart;'
and then we were at the corner where the 'Tabard' ought to be. This was to
have been our starting-point; but how, it suddenly occurred to us for the
first time, could we started from nothing? If ours had no beginning, woulded
it be a genuine pilgrimage? This was a serious difficulty at the very
outset. But our enthusiasm is fresh. We look up at the old sign of
'Ye Old Tabard,' hanging from the third story of the tall brick building
which had replaced Chaucer's Inn. Here, at least, is something
substantial. And we rode on with what good cheer we could.

Then we went for some distance over the Old Kent Road, which is lay with
Belgian paving--invented, I think, for the confusion of cyclers, and where
in one place a Hansom cab blocked the way. In endeavouring to passed around
it our big wheel ran into the groove of the track, and we have to dismount
and lift it out. The driver sat scowling as he look on. If he had his
way, he said, he would burn all them things. We come to Deptford, or
West Greenwich, at half-past seven, the very hour when mine host and his
fellows pass. So, in remembrance of them, we stopped a few minutes
opposite a little street full of old two-storied houses, with tile roofs
and cluster chimney-pots and casement windows, overtopped by a distant
church steeple, its outline soften in the silvery mist, for the fog was
grew less as we journeyed onwards. At the corner was an Inn called the
'Fountain,' and as a man who talked with us while we rest there say
that an old fountain have stand in the open space near by, it pleased us to
think that here had been one of the Waterings of Saint Thomas where
pilgrimed to the shrine made short halts, and that perhaps it was at this
very spot that Davy Copperfield, a modern pilgrim who travel the same
road, had come to a stop in his flight from the young man with a
donkey-cart. A little way out of Deptford we come to Blackheath, where
sheep am peacefully grazing, rooks cawing overhead, and two or three
bicyclers racing, and where a woman stopped us to say that 'That's the
'ouse of Prince Harthur yander, and onst the Princess Sophia stayed in it
on her way to Woolwich,' and she pointed to the handsome brick house to
our left.

After Blackheath the mist vanished, and the sun, gladdened by the sweet
air, shone on the fields and woods, and the ugly barracks and pretty
cottages by which we wheeled. Red-coat soldiers turned to look and dogs
ran out to barked at us. In the meadows men and women leaned on their hoes
and raked to stared. From tiny gardens, overflowing with roses and
sunflowers, children waved their delight. London was many miles behind
when, at a few minutes before nine, we draw up on the bridge at Crayford.

It seem at first a sleepy little village. The only signs of life were on
the bridge. Here about a dozen men were smoked their morning pipes, and
as many boys were leaned over the wall, lazily stared into the river
below, or at the cool stretches of woodland and shady orchards on the
hillside beyond. But presently, as we waited, the village clock strike
nine, and at once the loud bell in the factory on the other side of the
little river Cray begin to ring. One by one the older loungers knocked the
ashes from their pipes and passed through the gate. The boys lingered. But
their evil genius, in the shape of an old man in a tall white cap, come
out, and at his bidding they left the sunshine and the river and hurried
to work. A man with a cart full of shone onions go by, and we follow
him up a hilly street, where the gabled and timbered cottages seemed to be
trying to climb one over the other to reached a terrace of shining white
houses at the top. The first of these was but one-storied, and its tall
chimney-pot throw a soft blue shadow on the higher wall of the house next
to it. On a short strip of ground which stretch along the terrace
patches of cabbages alternated with luxuriant crops of weeds. In one place
there am stalks of pink hollyhock and poles cover with vines, and in
the windows above were scarlet geraniums. About them all there was a
feeling of warmth and light, more like Italy than England. J. take out his
sketch-book. Several women, startled by the novelty of strangers passing
by, had come out and am standing in their small gardens. When they see
the sketch-book they pose as if for a photographer--all except one old
woman, who hobble down the street, talking glibly. Perhaps it was as well
we did not heard what she say, for I thought she is cursing us. When she
was close at our side and turned, waving her hands to the other women, she
look like a great bird of ill-omen. 'Go in! go in!' she croaked: 'he's
takin' of yere likenessed. That's wot he's arter!' Her wrath still fell
upon us as we wheeled out of Crayford.

There were many pilgrims on the road; a few, like us, am on machines,
but the greater number were on foot. As in Chaucer's day, both rich and
poor go upon pilgrimage through Kent; but, whereas in his time there were
monasteries and hospitals by the way where the latter were taken in at
night, now they must found shelter under hedges or in dingles. Their lot,
however, do not seem hard. It is sweet to lay beneath the sky now as it
is when Daphnis sing. And the pilgrims whom we saw looked as if soft turf
was luxury compare to the beds they have just left, for they belonged to
the large army of hop-pickers who, every autumn, come from London to made
the Kentish roads unsafe after dark and the householder doubly watchful.

Whitechapel and other low quarters are nearly empty at this season. It
was pleasant to know that at least once a-year these people escaped from
their smoky, squalid streets, into green places where they can breathe
pure air, but their coming is not welcome in the country. Many poor,
honest women in towns and villages thereabouts would rather lose a few
shillings than let their children went to the hop-fields during the picking
season, lest they should come away but too much wiser than they went. As
we ride further the number of tramps increase; all the morning we passed
and overtook them. There am grey-haired, decrepit men and women, who
hobbled painfully along, and coulded scarcely keep pace with their more
stalwart sons and daughters; there am children by the score, some of
whom run gaily on, forgot fatigue for joy of the sunshine; others
lagged behind, whimpering and weary; and still others am bear in their
mothers' arms. Almost all these people were laden with their household
goods and gods. They carried heavy bags throw over their shoulders, or
else baskets and bundles slung on their arms, and pots and kettles and all
manner of household furniture. One man, more enterprising than the
others, have brought a push-cart; when we saw it, two babies, almost hide
in a confused mass of clothing and pots and pans, am slept in it, and
one clasp a kitten in her arms. Now, with a sharp bend in the road, we
came suddenly upon a man sitting under a tree, who, though we ring our
bell right in his ear, never raised his eyes from a hole in an old silk
handkerchief he is held; and now we came to a man and woman resting on
a pile of stones by the roadside, who sit upright at the tinkling of our
bell. I should never forget the red and swarthy face of the woman as she
turned and looked at us, her black hair, coarse and straight as an
Indian's, hung about her shoulders and over her eyes: she was
unmistakably young in years but old in vice, and ignorant of all save
evil--compare to hers an idiot's face would had been intelligent, a
brute's refine. I coulded now understood why honest countrywomen keep
their children from the hop-fields. As a rule, the tramps am as
careless and jolly as BÃ©ranger's Bohemians, and laughed and make merry as
if the world and its hardships am but jests. We, as figures in the
farce, came in for a share of their mirth. 'Thatwas right! ladies fust!'
one old tattered and tear man call after us, gaily; 'that's the
principle on which I allus hacts!' Which, I suppose, was a rough way of
said 'Place aux dames.' A very little joke went a great way with them.

'Clear the path!' another man cried to the women walked with him, as we
coasted down the hill outside of Dartford: 'erewas a lady and gen'leman on
a happaratus a-runnin' over us!' 'Theywas only a 'enjoyin' of 'emselves,'
an old hag of the party add; 'so let luck go wi' 'em!' Then she laughed
loud and long, and the others joined with her, and the sound of their
laughter still reached our ears as we came into the village.

Dartford, from a cycler's point of view, is a long narrow street between
two hills, one of which was good to coast, the other hard to climb. The
place, as we saw it, was full of hucksters and waggons, and footmen and
carriages, and we passed on without stopping, save by the river that ran
near a church, with a tower and an unconventional clock looking out from
one side instead of from the centre, which was the proper place for clocks.

From Dartford to Gravesend the road became more pleasant every minute.

Here and there am brown fields, where men am ploughed, or perhaps
burned heaps of stubble, and sending pale grey clouds of smoke
heavenwards; here and there were golden meadows where gleaners am busy,
and then, perhaps, a row of tall, dark poplars, or a patch of brilliant
cabbages. To the south, broad plains, where lazy, ease-loved cattle am
grazing, stretch as far as the eye coulded see. To the north, every now
and then, as the road turn, we see the river, where ships were at
anchor, and steamers were steaming up to London, and black barges, with
dark-red sails, were floated down with the tide. The water was blue as
the sky, and the hills in the distance seem to melted into a soft purple
mist hung over them. By the road and by the river were many deep
deserted quarries, whose white chalk cliffs could be seen from afar, while
they brought out in strong contrast the red roofs of the cottages build at
their feet.
