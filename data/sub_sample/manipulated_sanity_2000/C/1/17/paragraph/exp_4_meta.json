                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",

Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.

In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"

                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,",
                "-THE ALTAR OF THE DEAD-\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I.\n\n\nHe had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and loved\nthem still less when they made a pretence of a figure.  Celebrations and\nsuppressions were equally painful to him, and but one of the former found\na place in his life.  He had kept each year in his own fashion the date\nof Mary Antrim\u2019s death.  It would be more to the point perhaps to say\nthat this occasion kept _him_: it kept him at least effectually from\ndoing anything else.  It took hold of him again and again with a hand of\nwhich time had softened but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his\nfeast of memory as consciously as he would have waked to his\nmarriage-morn.  Marriage had had of old but too little to say to the\nmatter: for the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no\nbridal embrace.  She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day\nhad been fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection\nthat promised to fill his life to the brim.\n\nOf that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life\ncould really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, still\nordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of numerous\npassions, and even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with\nhim than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no priest and no altar\nto make him for ever widowed.  He had done many things in the world\u2014he\nhad done almost all but one: he had never, never forgotten.  He had tried\nto put into his existence whatever else might take up room in it, but had\nfailed to make it more than a house of which the mistress was eternally\nabsent.  She was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that\nhis tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his\nnerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy, and\nthe goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a London\nsuburb, a part then of Nature\u2019s breast, but which he had seen lose one\nafter another every feature of freshness.  It was in truth during the\nmoments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.  They looked\nat another image, they opened to another light.  Was it a credible\nfuture?  Was it an incredible past?  Whatever the answer it was an\nimmense escape from the actual.\n\nIt\u2019s true that if there weren\u2019t other dates than this there were other\nmemories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories\nhad greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his life than the\nghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more losses than most men,\nbut he had counted his losses more; he hadn\u2019t seen death more closely,\nbut had in a manner felt it more deeply.  He had formed little by little\nthe habit of numbering his Dead: it had come to him early in life that\nthere was something one had to do for them.  They were there in their\nsimplified intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive\npatience, as personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.\nWhen all sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if\ntheir purgatory were really still on earth: they asked so little that\nthey got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day, of the\nhard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no reserved place, no\nhonour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous people provided for the\nliving, but even those who were called most generous did nothing for the\nothers.  So on George Stransom\u2019s part had grown up with the years a\nresolve that he at least would do something, do it, that is, for his\nown\u2014would perform the great charity without reproach.  Every man _had_\nhis own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of\nthe soul.\n\nIt was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; as\nthe years at any rate went by he found himself in regular communion with\nthese postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he always called in his\nthoughts the Others.  He spared them the moments, he organised the\ncharity.  Quite how it had risen he probably never could have told you,\nbut what came to pass was that an altar, such as was after all within\neverybody\u2019s compass, lighted with perpetual candles and dedicated to\nthese secret rites, reared itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had\nwondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being\nvery sure, and not a little content, that he hadn\u2019t at all events the\nreligion some of the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually\nthis question was straightened out for him: it became clear to him that\nthe religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been simply the\nreligion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it satisfied his\nspirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered his love of great\noffices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more\nbedecked and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship\nwas attached.  He had no imagination about these things but that they\nwere accessible to any one who should feel the need of them.  The poorest\ncould build such temples of the spirit\u2014could make them blaze with candles\nand smoke with incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The\ncost, in the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the\ngenerous heart.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER II.\n\n\nHe had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an emotion\nnot unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home at the close of\na busy day he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect\nof a shop-front that lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin\nand before which several persons were gathered.  It was the window of a\njeweller whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like\nhigh notes of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were\n\u201cworth\u201d than most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other\nside of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision,\na string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept\nan instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.  Next him was a\nmumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on\nhis arm.  It was from him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded: he\nwas talking with the lady of some precious object in the window.\nStransom had no sooner recognised him than the old woman turned away; but\njust with this growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed\nhim in the very act of laying his hand on his friend\u2019s arm.  It lasted\nbut the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild\nquestion.  Was _not_ Mrs. Creston dead?\u2014the ambiguity met him there in\nthe short drop of her husband\u2019s voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was,\nand in the way the two figures leaned to each other.  Creston, making a\nstep to look at something else, came nearer, glanced at him, started and\nexclaimed\u2014behaviour the effect of which was at first only to leave\nStransom staring, staring back across the months at the different face,\nthe wholly other face, the poor man had shown him last, the blurred\nravaged mask bent over the open grave by which they had stood together.\nThat son of affliction wasn\u2019t in mourning now; he detached his arm from\nhis companion\u2019s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as\nwell as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a\ntentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was pretty\nbefore he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.  \u201cMy dear\nfellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.\u201d\n\nCreston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the\nrate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for our\nfriend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and laughed and\ntalked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep\nit for private consumption.  He felt himself grimace, he heard himself\nexaggerate the proper, but was conscious of turning not a little faint.\nThat new woman, that hired performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had\nbeen more living for him than any woman but one.  This lady had a face\nthat shone as publicly as the jeweller\u2019s window, and in the happy candour\nwith which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross\nimmodesty.  The character of Paul Creston\u2019s wife thus attributed to her\nwas monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to know\nperfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from America,\nand Stransom hadn\u2019t needed to be told this to guess the nationality of\nthe lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband\u2019s\nconfused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom recalled that he had\nheard of poor Creston\u2019s having, while his bereavement was still fresh,\ncrossed the sea for what people in such predicaments call a little\nchange.  He had found the little change indeed, he had brought the little\nchange back; it was the little change that stood there and that, do what\nhe would, he couldn\u2019t, while he showed those high front teeth of his,\nlook other than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop,\nMrs. Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help\nto decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement\nfor which he was already late, and they parted while she shrieked into\nthe fog, \u201cMind now you come to see me right away!\u201d  Creston had had the\ndelicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to\nhear her scream it to all the echoes.\n\nHe felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near\nher.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn\u2019t to have shown\nher without precautions, oughtn\u2019t indeed to have shown her at all.  His\nprecautions should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the\npeople at home would never have mentioned extradition.  This was a wife\nfor foreign service or purely external use; a decent consideration would\nhave spared her the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of\nGeorge Stransom\u2019s reaction; but as he sat alone that night\u2014there were\nparticular hours he always passed alone\u2014the harshness dropped from it and\nleft only the pity.  _He_ could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if\nthe man to whom she had given everything couldn\u2019t.  He had known her\ntwenty years, and she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have\nbeen unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her\nhouse had been the very easiest in all the world and her friendship the\nvery firmest.  Without accidents he had loved her, without accidents\nevery one had loved her: she had made the passions about her as regular\nas the moon makes the tides.  She had been also of course far too good\nfor her husband, but he never suspected it, and in nothing had she been\nmore admirable than in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep\nevery one else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.\nHere was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had\ngiven it up\u2014dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had\nhad only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on her\ngrave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.\nThe frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom\u2019s eyes fill; and he had\nthat evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a world without delicacy,\nhad a right to hold up his head.  While he smoked, after dinner, he had a\nbook in his lap, but he",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-SCALLY: The Story of a Perfect Gentleman-\n\n\nCHAPTER: I\n\n\n\"BETTERSEA trem? Right, miss!\" My wife, who has been married long\nenough to feel deeply gratified at being mistaken for a maiden lady,\nsmiled seraphically at the conductor, and allowed herself to be hoisted\nup the steps of the majestic vehicle provided by a paternal county\ncouncil to convey passengers--at a loss to the ratepayers, I\nunderstand--from the Embankment to Battersea.\n\nPresently we ground our way round a curve and began to cross Westminster\nBridge. The conductor, whose innate cockney bonhomie his high official\nposition had failed to eradicate, presented himself before us and\ncollected our fares.\n\n\"What part of Bettersea did you require, sir?\" he asked of me.\n\nI coughed and answered evasively:--\n\"Oh, about the middle.\"\n\n\"We haven't been there before,\" added my wife, quite gratuitously.\n\nThe conductor smiled indulgently and punched our tickets.\n\n\"I'll tell you when to get down,\" he said, and left us.\n\nFor some months we had been considering the question of buying a dog,\nand a good deal of our spare time--or perhaps I should say of my spare\ntime, for a woman's time is naturally all her own--had been pleasantly\noccupied in discussing the matter. Having at length committed ourselves\nto the purchase of the animal, we proceeded to consider such details as\nbreed, sex, and age.\n\nMy wife vacillated between a bloodhound, because bloodhounds are so\naristocratic in appearance, and a Pekinese, because they are dernier\ncri. We like to be dernier cri even in Much Moreham. Her younger\nsister, Eileen, who spends a good deal of time with us, having no\nparents of her own, suggested an Old English sheep dog, explaining that\nit would be company for my wife when I was away from home. I coldly\nrecommended a mastiff.\n\nOur son John, aged three, on being consulted, expressed a preference for\ntwelve tigers in a box, and was not again invited to participate in the\ndebate.\n\nFinally we decided on an Aberdeen terrier, of an age and sex to be\nsettled by circumstances, and I was instructed to communicate with a\ngentleman in the North who advertised in our morning paper that Aberdeen\nterriers were his specialty. In due course we received a reply. The\nadvertiser recommended two animals--namely, Celtic Chief, aged four\nmonths, and Scotia's Pride, aged one year. Pedigrees were inclosed, each\nabout as complicated as the family tree of the House of Hapsburg; and\nthe favor of an early reply was requested, as both dogs were being hotly\nbid for by an anonymous client in Constantinople.\n\nThe price of Celtic Chief was twenty guineas; that of Scotia's Pride,\nfor reasons heavily underlined in the pedigree, was twenty-seven. The\nadvertiser, who resided in Aberdeen, added that these prices did not\ncover cost of carriage. We decided not to stand in the way of the\ngentleman in Constantinople, and having sent back the pedigrees by\nreturn of post, resumed the debate.\n\nFinally Stella, my wife, said:--\n\"We don't really want a dog with a pedigree. We only want something that\nwill bark at beggars and be gentle with baby. Why not go to the Home for\nLost Dogs at Battersea? I believe you can get any dog you like there for\nfive shillings. We will run up to town next Wednesday and see about\nit--and I might get some clothes as well.\"\n\nHence our presence on the tram.\n\nPresently the conductor, who had kindly pointed out to us such objects\nof local interest as the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament,\nstopped the tram in a crowded thoroughfare and announced that we were in\nBattersea.\n\n\"Alight here,\" he announced facetiously, \"for 'Ome for Lost Dawgs!\"\n\nGuiltily realizing that there is many a true word spoken in jest, we\nobeyed him, and the tram went rocking and whizzing out of sight. We had\neschewed a cab.\n\n\"When you are only going to pay five shillings for a dog,\" my wife had\npointed out, with convincing logic, \"it is silly to go and pay perhaps\nanother five shillings for a cab. It doubles the price of the dog at\nonce. If we had been buying an expensive dog we might have taken a cab;\nbut not for a five-shilling one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" I inquired briskly, \"how are we going to find this place?\"\n\n\"Haven't you any idea where it is?\"\n\n\"No. I have a sort of vague notion that it is on an island in the middle\nof the river, called the Isle of Dogs, or Barking Reach, or something\nlike that. However, I have no doubt--\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better ask some one?\" suggested Stella.\n\nI demurred.\n\n\"If there is one thing I dislike,\" I said, \"it is accosting total\nstrangers and badgering them for information they don't possess--not\nthat that will prevent them from giving it. If we start asking the way\nwe shall find ourselves in Putney or Woolwich in no time!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Stella soothingly.\n\n\"Now I suggest--\" My hand went to my pocket.\n\n\"No, darling,\" interposed my wife, hastily; \"not a map, please!\" It is a\ncurious psychological fact that women have a constitutional aversion to\nmaps and railroad time-tables. They would rather consult a half-witted\nerrand boy or a deaf railroad porter. \"Do not let us make a spectacle of\nourselves in the public streets again! I have not yet forgotten the day\nwhen you tried to find the Crystal Palace. Besides, it will only blow\naway. Ask that dear little boy there. He is looking at us so wistfully.\"\n\nYes; I admit it was criminal folly. A man who asks a London street boy\nto be so kind as to direct him to a Home for Lost Dogs has only himself\nto thank for the consequence.\n\nThe wistful little boy smiled up at us. He had a pinched face and large\neyes.\n\n\"Lost Dogs' 'Ome, sir?\" he said courteously. \"It's a good long way. Do\nyou want to get there quick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then if I was you, sir,\" replied the infant, edging to the mouth of an\nalleyway, \"I should bite a policeman!\" And, with an ear-splitting yell,\nhe vanished.\n\nWe walked on, hot-faced.\n\n\"Little wretch!\" said Stella.\n\n\"We simply asked for it,\" I rejoined. \"What are we going to do next?\"\n\nMy question was answered in a most incredible fashion, for at this\nmoment a man emerged from a shop on our right and set off down the\nstreet before us. He wore a species of uniform; and emblazoned on the\nfront of his hat was the information that he was an official of the\nBattersea Home for Lost and Starving Dogs.\n\n\"Wait a minute and I will ask him,\" I said, starting forward.\n\nBut my wife would not hear of it.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied. \"If we ask him he will simply offer to\nshow us the way. Then we shall have to talk to him--about hydrophobia,\nand lethal chambers, and distemper--and it may be for miles. I simply\ncouldn't bear it! We shall have to tip him, too. Let us follow him\nquietly.\"\n\nTo those who have never attempted to track a fellow creature\nsurreptitiously through the streets of London on a hot day, the feat may\nappear simple. It is in reality a most exhausting, dilatory, and\nhumiliating exercise. Our difficulty lay not so much in keeping our\nfriend in sight as in avoiding frequent and unexpected collisions with\nhim. The general idea, as they say on field days, was to keep about\ntwenty yards behind him; but under certain circumstances distance has an\nuncanny habit of annihilating itself. The man himself was no hustler.\n\nOnce or twice he stopped to light his pipe or converse with a friend.\n\nDuring these interludes Stella and I loafed guiltily on the pavement,\npointing out to one another objects of local interest with the fatuous\nofficiousness of people in the foreground of hotel advertisements.\n\nOccasionally he paused to contemplate the contents of a shop window. We\ngazed industriously into the window next door. Our first window, I\nrecollect, was an undertaker's, with ready-printed expressions of grief\nfor sale on white porcelain disks. We had time to read them all. The\nnext was a butcher's. Here we stayed, perforce, so long that the\nproprietor, who was of the tribe that disposes of its wares almost\nentirely by personal canvass, came out into the street and endeavored to\nsell us a bullock's heart.\n\nOur quarry's next proceeding was to dive into a public house. We turned\nand surveyed one another.\n\n\"What are we to do now?\" inquired my wife.\n\n\"Go inside, too,\" I replied with more enthusiasm than I had hitherto\ndisplayed. \"At least, I think I ought to. You can please yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not be left in the street,\" said Stella firmly. \"We must just\nwait here together until he comes out.\"\n\n\"There may be another exit,\" I objected. \"We had better go in. I shall\ntake something, just to keep up appearances; and you must sit down in\nthe ladies' bar, or the snug, or whatever they call it.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Stella.\n\nWe had arrived at this impasse when the man suddenly reappeared,\nwiping his mouth. Instantly and silently we fell in behind him.\n\nFor the first time the man appeared to notice our presence. He regarded\nus curiously, with a faint gleam of recognition in his eyes, and then\nset off down the street at a good pace. We followed, panting. Once or\ntwice he looked back over his shoulder a little apprehensively, I\nthought. But we ploughed on.\n\n\"We ought to get there soon at this pace,\" I gasped. \"Hello! He's gone\nagain!\"\n\n\"He turned down to the right,\" said Stella excitedly.\n\nThe lust of the chase was fairly on us now. We swung eagerly round the\ncorner into a quiet by-street. Our man was nowhere to be seen and the\nstreet was almost empty.\n\n\"Come on!\" said Stella. \"He may have turned in somewhere.\"\n\nWe hurried down the street. Suddenly, warned by a newly awakened and\nprimitive instinct, I looked back. We had overrun our quarry. He had\njust emerged from some hiding place and was heading back toward the main\nstreet, looking fearfully over his shoulder. Once more we were in full\ncry.\n\nFor the next five minutes we practically ran--all three of us. The man\nwas obviously frightened out of his wits, and kept making frenzied and\nspasmodic spurts, from which we surmised that he was getting to the end\nof his powers of endurance.\n\n\"If only we could overtake him,\" I said, hauling my exhausted spouse\nalong by the arm, \"we could explain that--\"\n\n\"He's gone again!\" exclaimed Stella.\n\nShe was right. The man had turned another corner. We followed him round\nhotfoot, and found ourselves in a prim little cul-de-sac, with villas\non each side. Across the end of the street ran a high wall, obviously\nscreening a railroad track.\n\n\"We've got him!\" I exclaimed.\n\nI felt as Moltke must have felt when he closed the circle at Sedan.\n\n\"But where is the Dogs' Home, dear?\" inquired Stella.\n\nThe question was never answered, for at this moment the man ran up the\nsteps of the fourth villa on the left and slipped a latchkey into the\nlock. The door closed behind him with a venomous snap and we were left\nalone in the street, guideless and dogless.\n\nA minute later the man appeared at the ground-floor window, accompanied\nby a female of commanding appearance. He pointed us out to her. Behind\nthem we could dimly descry a white tablecloth, a tea cozy and covered\ndishes.\n\nThe commanding female, after a prolonged and withering glare, plucked a\nhairpin from her head and ostentatiously proceeded to skewer together\nthe starchy white curtains that framed the window. Privacy secured and\nthe sanctity of the English home thus pointedly vindicated, she and her\nhusband disappeared into the murky background, where they doubtless sat\ndown to an excellent high tea. Exhausted and discomfited, we drifted\naway.\n\n\"I am going home,\" said Stella in a hollow voice. \"And I think,\" she\nadded bitterly, \"that it might have occurred to you to suggest that the\ncreature might possibly be going from the Dogs' Home and not to it.\"\n\nI apologized. It is the simplest plan, really.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II\n\n\nIT was almost dark when the train arrived at our little country\nstation. We set out to walk home by the short cut across the golf\ncourse.\n\n\"Anyhow, we have saved five shillings,\" remarked Stella.\n\n\"We paid half a crown for that taxi which took us back to Victoria\nStation,\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Do not argue to-night, darling,\" responded my wife. \"I simply cannot\nendure anything more.\"\n\nPlainly she was a little unstrung. Very considerately, I selected\nanother topic.\n\n\"I think our best plan,\" I said cheerfully, \"would be to advertise for a\ndog.\"\n\n\"I never wish to see a dog again,\" replied Stella.\n\nI surveyed her with some concern and said gently:--\n\"I am afraid you are tired, dear.\"\n\n\"No; I'm not.\"\n\n\"A little shaken, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Joe, what is that?\"\n\nStella's fingers bit deep into my biceps muscle, causing me considerable\npain. We were passing a small sheet of water which guards the thirteenth\ngreen on"
