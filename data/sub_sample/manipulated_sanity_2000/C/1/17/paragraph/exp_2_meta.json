                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day?

There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday.

It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit?

As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"

                "-The Feast of St. Friend-\n\n\nCHAPTER: ONE - THE FACT\n\n\nSomething has happened to Christmas, or to our hearts; or to both. In\norder to be convinced of this it is only necessary to compare the\npresent with the past. In the old days of not so long ago the festival\nbegan to excite us in November. For weeks the house rustled with\ncharming and thrilling secrets, and with the furtive noises of paper\nparcels being wrapped and unwrapped; the house was a whispering gallery.\n\nThe tension of expectancy increased to such a point that there was a\npositive danger of the cord snapping before it ought to snap. On the\nEve we went to bed with no hope of settled sleep. We knew that we should\nbe wakened and kept awake by the waits singing in the cold; and we were\nglad to be kept awake so. On the supreme day we came downstairs hiding\ndelicious yawns, and cordially pretending that we had never been more\nfit. The day was different from other days; it had a unique romantic\nquality, tonic, curative of all ills. On that day even the tooth-ache\nvanished, retiring far into the wilderness with the spiteful word, the\nvenomous thought, and the unlovely gesture. We sang with gusto\n\"Christians awake, salute the happy morn.\" We did salute the happy morn.\n\nAnd when all the parcels were definitely unpacked, and the secrets of\nall hearts disclosed, we spent the rest of the happy morn in waiting,\ncandidly greedy, for the first of the great meals. And then we ate, and\nwe drank, and we ate again; with no thought of nutrition, nor of\nreasonableness, nor of the morrow, nor of dyspepsia. We ate and drank\nwithout fear and without shame, in the sheer, abandoned ecstasy of\ncelebration. And by means of motley paper headgear, fit only for a\ncarnival, we disguised ourselves in the most absurd fashions, and yet\ndid not make ourselves seriously ridiculous; for ridicule is in the\nvision, not in what is seen. And we danced and sang and larked, until we\ncould no more. And finally we chanted a song of ceremony, and separated;\nending the day as we had commenced it, with salvoes of good wishes. And\nthe next morning we were indisposed and enfeebled; and we did not care;\nwe suffered gladly; we had our pain's worth, and more. This was the\npast.\n\nEven today the spirit and rites of ancient Christmas are kept up, more\nor less in their full rigour and splendour, by a race of beings that is\nscattered over the whole earth. This race, mysterious, masterful,\nconservative, imaginative, passionately sincere, arriving from we know\nnot where, dissolving before our eyes we know not how, has its way in\nspite of us. I mean the children. By virtue of the children's faith, the\nreindeer are still tramping the sky, and Christmas Day is still\nsomething above and beyond a day of the week; it is a day out of the\nweek. We have to sit and pretend; and with disillusion in our souls we\ndo pretend. At Christmas, it is not the children who make-believe; it\nis ourselves. Who does not remember the first inkling of a suspicion\nthat Christmas Day was after all a day rather like any other day? In the\nhouse of my memories, it was the immemorial duty of my brother on\nChristmas morning, before anything else whatever happened, to sit down\nto the organ and perform \"Christians Awake\" with all possible stops\ndrawn. He had to do it. Tradition, and the will that emanated from the\nbest bedroom, combined to force him to do it. One Christmas morning, as\nhe was preparing the stops, he glanced aside at me with a supercilious\ncurl of the lips, and the curl of my lips silently answered. It was as\nif he had said: \"I condescend to this,\" and as if I had said: \"So do I.\"\n\nSuch a moment comes to most of us of this generation. And thenceforward\nthe change in us is extraordinarily rapid. The next thing we know is\nthat the institution of waits is a rather annoying survival which at\nonce deprives us of sleep and takes money out of our pockets. And then\nChristmas is gluttony and indigestion and expensiveness and quarter-day,\nand Christmas cards are a tax and a nuisance, and present-giving is a\nheavier tax and a nuisance. And we feel self-conscious and foolish as we\nsing \"Auld Lang Syne.\" And what a blessing it will be when the\n\"festivities\" (as they are misleadingly called) are over, and we can\nsettle down into commonsense again!\n\nI do not mean that our hearts are black with despair on Christmas Day.\n\nI do not mean that we do not enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. There is\nno doubt that, with the inspiriting help of the mysterious race, and by\nthe force of tradition, and by our own gift of pretending, we do still\nvery much enjoy ourselves on Christmas Day. What I mean to insinuate,\nand to assert, is that beneath this enjoyment is the disconcerting and\ndistressing conviction of unreality, of non-significance, of exaggerated\nand even false sentiment. What I mean is that we have to brace and force\nourselves up to the enjoyment of Christmas. We have to induce\ndeliberately the \"Christmas feeling.\" We have to remind ourselves that\n\"it will never do\" to let the heartiness of Christmas be impaired. The\npeculiarity of our attitude towards Christmas, which at worst is a\nvacation, may be clearly seen by contrasting it with our attitude\ntowards another vacation--the summer holiday. We do not have to brace\nand force ourselves up to the enjoyment of the summer holiday. We\nexperience no difficulty in inducing the holiday feeling. There is no\nfear of the institution of the summer holiday losing its heartiness. Nor\ndo we need the example of children to aid us in savouring the August\n\"festivities.\"\n\nIf any person here breaks in with the statement that I am deceived and\nthe truth is not in me, and that Christmas stands just where it did in\nthe esteem of all right-minded people, and that he who casts a doubt on\nthe heartiness of Christmas is not right-minded, let that person read no\nmore. This book is not written for him. And if any other person,\nkindlier, condescendingly protests that there is nothing wrong with\nChristmas except my advancing age, let that person read no more. This\nbook is not written for him, either. It is written for persons who can\nlook facts cheerfully in the face. That Christmas has lost some of its\nmagic is a fact that the common sense of the western hemisphere will not\ndispute. To blink the fact is infantile. To confront it, to try to\nunderstand it, to reckon with it, and to obviate any evil that may\nattach to it--this course alone is meet for an honest man.\n\n\nCHAPTER: TWO - THE REASON\n\n\nIf the decadence of Christmas were a purely subjective phenomenon,\nconfined to the breasts of those of us who have ceased to be children\nthen it follows that Christmas has always been decadent, because people\nhave always been ceasing to be children. It follows also that the\nfestival was originally got up by disillusioned adults, for the benefit\nof the children. Which is totally absurd. Adults have never yet invented\nany institution, festival or diversion specially for the benefit of\nchildren. The egoism of adults makes such an effort impossible, and the\ningenuity and pliancy of children make it unnecessary. The pantomime,\nfor example, which is now pre-eminently a diversion for children, was\ncreated by adults for the amusement of adults. Children have merely\naccepted it and appropriated it. Children, being helpless, are of course\nfatalists and imitators. They take what comes, and they do the best they\ncan with it. And when they have made something their own that was adult,\nthey stick to it like leeches.\n\nThey are terrific Tories, are children; they are even reactionary! They\npowerfully object to changes. What they most admire in a pantomime is\nthe oldest part of it, the only true pantomime--the harlequinade! Hence\nthe very nature of children is a proof that what Christmas is now to\nthem, it was in the past to their elders. If they now feel and exhibit\nfaith and enthusiasm in the practice of the festival, be sure that, at\none time, adults felt and exhibited the same faith and enthusiasm--yea,\nand more! For in neither faith nor enthusiasm can a child compete with a\nconvinced adult. No child could believe in anything as passionately as\nthe modern millionaire believes in money, or as the modern social\nreformer believes in the virtue of Acts of Parliament.\n\nAnother and a crowning proof that Christmas has been diminished in our\nhearts lies in the fiery lyrical splendour of the old Christmas hymns.\n\nThose hymns were not written by people who made-believe at Christmas for\nthe pleasure of youngsters. They were written by devotees. And this age\ncould not have produced them.\n\nNo! The decay of the old Christmas spirit among adults is undeniable,\nand its cause is fairly plain. It is due to the labours of a set of\nidealists--men who cared not for money, nor for glory, nor for anything\nexcept their ideal. Their ideal was to find out the truth concerning\nnature and concerning human history; and they sacrificed all--they\nsacrificed the peace of mind of whole generations--to the pleasure of\nslaking their ardour for truth. For them the most important thing in the\nworld was the satisfaction of their curiosity. They would leave naught\nalone; and they scorned consequences. Useless to cry to them: \"That is\nholy. Touch it not!\" I mean the great philosophers and men of\nscience--especially the geologists--of the nineteenth century. I mean\nsuch utterly pure-minded men as Lyell, Spencer, Darwin and Huxley. They\ninaugurated the mighty age of doubt and scepticism. They made it\nimpossible to believe all manner of things which before them none had\nquestioned. The movement spread until uneasiness was everywhere in the\nrealm of thought, and people walked about therein fearsomely, as in a\nland subject to earthquakes. It was as if people had said: \"We don't\nknow what will topple next. Let's raze everything to the ground, and\nthen we shall feel safer.\" And there came a moment after which nobody\ncould ever look at a picture of the Nativity in the old way. Pictures of\nthe Nativity were admired perhaps as much as ever, but for the exquisite\nbeauty of their na\u00efvet\u00e9, the charm of their old-world simplicity, not\nas artistic renderings of fact.\n\nAn age of scepticism has its faults, like any other age, though certain\npersons have pretended the contrary. Having been compelled to abandon\nits belief in various statements of alleged fact, it lumps principles\nand ideals with alleged facts, and hastily decides not to believe in\nanything at all. It gives up faith, it despises faith, in spite of the\nwarning of its greatest philosophers, including Herbert Spencer, that\nfaith of some sort is necessary to a satisfactory existence in a\nuniverse full of problems which science admits it can never solve. None\nwere humbler than the foremost scientists about the narrowness of the\nfield of knowledge, as compared with the immeasurability of the field\nof faith. But the warning has been ignored, as warnings nearly always\nare. Faith is at a discount. And the qualities which go with faith are\nat a discount; such as enthusiasm, spontaneity, ebullition, lyricism,\nand self-expression in general. Sentimentality is held in such horror\nthat people are afraid even of sentiment. Their secret cry is: \"Give us\nsomething in which we can believe.\"\n\nThey forget, in their confusion, that the great principles, spiritual\nand moral, remain absolutely intact. They forget that, after all the\nshattering discoveries of science and conclusions of philosophy, mankind\nhas still to live with dignity amid hostile nature, and in the presence\nof an unknowable power and that mankind can only succeed in this\ntremendous feat by the exercise of faith and of that mutual goodwill\nwhich is based in sincerity and charity. They forget that, while facts\nare nothing, these principles are everything. And so, at that epoch of\nthe year which nature herself has ordained for the formal recognition of\nthe situation of mankind in the universe and of its resulting duties to\nitself and to the Unknown--at that epoch, they bewail, sadly or\nimpatiently or cynically: \"Oh! The bottom has been knocked out of\nChristmas!\"\n\nBut the bottom has not been knocked out of Christmas. And people know\nit. Somewhere, in the most central and mysterious fastness of their\nhearts, they know it. If they were not, in spite of themselves,\nconvinced of it, why should they be so pathetically anxious to keep\nalive in themselves, and to foster in their children, the Christmas\nspirit? Obviously, a profound instinct is for ever reminding them that,\nwithout the Christmas spirit, they are lost. The forms",
                "-The Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. As Taught by the Church of England-\n\n\nCHAPTER: INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIT is a very easy thing to make a confident assertion, and such\nassertions produce a greater effect on many minds than the most careful\nand best-established proof.  Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to\nhear it asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed \u2018The\nDoctrine of the Real Presence,\u2019 is taught by the Church of England; and\nthe result is that a considerable number of persons believe in the\nassertion, and place reliance on those who make it, as if they, and they\nonly, were the true expositors of the Church\u2019s doctrine.  In many cases a\nblind consent is blindly given.  The Scriptures are not investigated\nbecause the point is supposed to have been settled by the Church, and the\ndocuments of the Church are not studied because the doctrine is regarded\nas beyond the reach of doubt; whereas, if the real groundwork of that\nopinion were examined, it would be found to consist in nothing more than\nconfident assertion.  But those who are loyal to the Church of England\nought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its teaching.\n\nThe issues at stake are far too serious, and, now that after three\nhundred years of faithful service the Church of England is entering on\nsuch a sifting time as she has never yet experienced, it is only fair to\nher that her own language should be patiently heard, and her own teaching\nhonestly examined.  This, then, is the object of this address.  I am not\nabout to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of England;\nand my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid examination of\nher own documents whether there is, or is not, any authority for the\nassertion that she teaches what is commonly called \u2018The Doctrine of the\nReal Presence.\u2019  In doing this, our first business is to ascertain what\nis the real point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may\nappear, as amongst those who maintain that doctrine there are no\nauthoritative documents on the subject to which we can refer.  But, I\nbelieve, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal points at\nissue under the three heads of the Real Presence, Adoration, and\nSacrifice; and these three I propose to investigate in that order.\n\n\nCHAPTER: CHAPTER I. - THE REAL PRESENCE.\n\n\nTHIS lies at the foundation of the whole controversy, and to this our\nfirst and chief attention must be directed.  Now, there can be no doubt\non the minds of those who take the Word of God as their true and only\nguide that it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by\nfaith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed Saviour.  I am\nnot now discussing in what way we feed on Him, or whether His words in\nthe 6th chapter of St. John refer, or do not refer, to the Sacrament of\nthe Lord\u2019s Supper.  It is my own belief that they do not; but that is not\nthe present question.  My present concern is with the fact that, however\nwe explain His words, we are taught by our Lord Himself that such a\nfeeding is essential to our life: \u2018Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of\nMan, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\u2019  Nor can there be any\ndoubt that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1) of the body\nand blood of Christ is connected with the Lord\u2019s Supper.  I am not now\nmaking any assertion as to the way in which it is connected, for that is\nthe great point to be determined.  All that I now say is that there\nclearly is a connexion, for the words are: \u2018The cup of blessing which we\nbless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which\nwe break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being\nmany, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one\nbread.\u2019\nTwo things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there is a feeding\non the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour, without which none can\nlive, and that the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper is in some way or other\nconnected with that sacred privilege.  Thus far, I presume, we are all\nagreed.  But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the widest\npossible divergence.  Rome teaches that by the act of consecration the\nbread and wine become Christ Himself; that the bread and wine cease to be\nbread and wine, and that both the bread and wine become each of them a\nwhole Christ, body, soul, and divinity.  The advocates for the doctrine\nof the Real Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can\nunderstand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely, that\nthey maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have the accidents\nof bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken of as bread and wine,\nalthough they have become the body and blood of Christ, or rather Christ\nHimself.  This slight difference is of no practical importance in the\ndiscussion, and appears to have been introduced only to avoid the\nconclusion drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and\nthe wine as wine, after consecration.  The practical conclusion is the\nsame, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the bread and in the\nwine.  This is what is meant by the expression, \u2018The real objective\npresence.\u2019  It means that He is present in the elements as a real\nindependent object, without any reference to the character of the\nrecipient, as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who\nholds it, without any reference to his state of mind or character.  In\nopposition to this, it is maintained by us who cling to the great\nprinciples of the Reformation, that there is no change whatever in the\nbread and wine, that they are solemnly set apart for sacramental use by\nmeans of consecration, but that they remain exactly the same as before\nconsecration, in substance, and accidents, and everything else.  That the\nmost precious body and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and\nthat the soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.  That there are two\nperfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the other\nspiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul; and two\nperfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating the bread, the\nother of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by faith.  That the material\nfood is an emblem of the spiritual; and that the act of eating by the\nbody is an emblem of the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of\nthe two are so far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we\nreceive the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the\nreality.  When the body feeds materially on the one, the believer\u2019s heart\nfeeds spiritually on the other; but the two acts are distinct, and the\none must not be confounded with the other.  From this statement it will\nappear that the point at issue is, whether the precious body and blood of\nour blessed Lord and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to\nbe eaten and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are\nreceived, or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is\nreceived by the soul alone without being localised in the consecrated\nelements.  And my object is to endeavour to ascertain which of these two\nsystems is taught by the Church of England.  That dear old Church is at\nthis present time in a position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the\nmost earnest prayers of all those who love the truth.  Some are\nendeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to uphold it in\nits integrity.  In such a state of things it is not fair that the Church\nshould be held responsible for the assertions even of its friends.  Its\nown voice ought to be heard, and its own clear statement carefully\nstudied.  I have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the\nsubject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will turn at\nonce to those authoritative documents for which the Church has made\nherself responsible.  These are the Articles, Catechism, Liturgy, and\nHomilies; and these, if it please God, we will examine in order.\n\nThe Articles.\u2014There are seven Articles\u2014xxv. to xxxi.\u2014bearing more or\nless upon the subject; and from these we may gather the real teaching of\nour Church.  The first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in\ngeneral.  \u2018Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of\nChristian men\u2019s professions, but rather they be certain sure witnesses\nand effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the\nwhich He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\nstrengthen and confirm our faith in Him.\u2019  In other words, before men\nthey are badges of our profession, and before God they are signs or\nwitnesses by which God works invisibly in the soul.  In this definition\nthere is no idea of any change in the substance of the sign.  The sign is\nnot described as being changed into the thing signified, but as being\naccompanied by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip\nvisibly receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace\ninvisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.  The visible sign and\nthe invisible gift are therefore kept quite distinct.  The one is\nmercifully granted in connexion with the other, but never said to be\nincorporated with it, for the sign would cease to be a sign if it were\nchanged into the thing signified.  With this definition of a Sacrament,\nthe 27th Article\u2014which describes that of baptism\u2014exactly agrees.  It\ndescribes it not merely as a badge of a Christian man\u2019s profession, but\nalso declares that it is a sign and means of grace.  \u2018A sign of\nregeneration or new birth;\u2019 a \u2018means whereby as by an instrument, they\nthat receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the Church; (2) the\npromises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God\nby the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed,\nand grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.\u2019  But no change is here\ndescribed as taking place in the water.  It is nowhere said to be changed\ninto regeneration.  The gifts described are God\u2019s direct gifts to the\nsoul, and are never said to be infused into the element of water.  The\nwater is sanctified, or set apart for sacramental use, but the\nconsecration produces no change in its quality or substance.  The new\nbirth is not in the water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in\nthe soul.  The minister on earth visibly administers the visible sign to\nthe body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly bestows the invisible\ngift on the soul.  It is not my business now to discuss the connexion\nbetween the visible sign and the invisible gift.  It is enough for my\npresent purpose to point out that the one is not changed into the other,\nbut that the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does\nnot cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into the thing\nsignified.\n\nNow it would be strange indeed if after having first given so perfectly\nclear a general definition of the general nature of a sacrament, and\nhaving so clearly defined baptism, in perfect harmony with that general\ndefinition, our Church were afterwards to teach a doctrine respecting the\nLord\u2019s Supper, altogether at variance with the general definition, and\nwith her own explanation of the other sacrament.  The Church of England\nincludes both sacraments in one definition, and in that definition she\nnever alludes to any change in the sign or elements.  In the sacrament of\nbaptism, no one, I believe, would for a moment assert the existence of\nsuch a change, even if there were no special Article on the subject.  Our\nconclusion therefore must be, that,"
