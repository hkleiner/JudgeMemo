                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout.

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",

With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.

                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"

                "-Masterpieces in Colour - BOUCHER-\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE SMALL BEGINNINGS\n\n\nThe year after good Queen Anne came to rule over us, Louis the\nFourteenth being still King of France, on an autumn day in the October\nof 1703, that saw the trees of Paris shedding their parched leaves as\na carpet to the feet of the much-bewigged dandified folk who stepped\nit swaggeringly down the walks of the Palais Royal, swinging long\ncanes, and strutting along the shaded promenades of the more\nfashionable places of the city, there stood in the vestry of the\nparish church of Saint Jean-en-Gr\u00e8ve a little group of the small\nburgess folk, gathered about a little infant, whilst the tipstaff to\nthe king's palace, one Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost, signed solemnly as witness to\nthe birth-certificate and as acknowledged godfather to the aforesaid\nmorsel of humanity, which, as the certificate badly set forth in black\nand white for ever, was henceforth to be known for good or ill as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, first-born son, on the 29th of September, four days\npast, of the tipstaff's friend, Nicolas Boucher, \"ma\u00eetre-peintre,\" who\nstood hard by, and of his wife Elizabeth Lemesle.\n\nThe worthy tipstaff's writing done, he bowed in the best Court manner\nto Mademoiselle Boullenois, daughter to yonder consequential fellow,\nthe law officer from the Police Court; and handed her the inked quill\nto bear witness in her turn as godmother.\n\nThe sand being flung upon the wet ink, and the blotting done,\nthere was exchange of compliments in the stilted manner of\ngood-fellowship of the day between priest and party--tapping of\nsnuff-boxes and taking of snuff, with more than a little gossip of the\nCourt and some shaking of heads, and under-lips solemnly thrust forth;\nthe gossip is not without authority and weight, for is not godfather\nPr\u00e9vost tipstaff to the king's majesty, therefore in the whirl of\nthings?\n\nThe child, indeed, was born into a Paris agog with stirring affairs.\n\nWell might heads be shaken solemnly. The French arms were knowing\ndefeat. The Englishman, Marlborough, was flinging back the French\narmies wheresoever he gave them battle. Europe was one great armed\ncamp. France was suffering terrible blood-letting. Defeat came on\ndefeat. These were sorry times. On land all went wrong. Good generals\nwere set aside; intriguing good-for-nothings led the veterans into\ndisaster. But there was still France upon the high seas.\n\nThen the women folk, bored with high politics, would draw back the\ntalk to the infant Fran\u00e7ois, and there would be genial banter about\nthe morsel; for was he not a Saturday child, therefore bound to be a\nbit of a scamp!\n\nAnd so, off to Monsieur Boucher's modest little home in the Rue de\nVerrerie to a glass of wine and further compliments and banter, and\nmore vague surmises as to what lay upon the knees of the gods for\nlittle Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\n\nCHAPTER: THE STUDENT\n\n\nYes, the sun of the Grand Monarque was setting. Louis Quatorze was\nnearing the end of his long lease of splendour. Our little Fran\u00e7ois\nwas not a month old when Admiral Rooke whipped Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud off the\nhigh seas, destroying the French and Spanish fleets in Vigo Bay, and\ncarrying off some millions of pieces of eight from the galleons as\ntreasure. The child's first year saw the English troopers ride down\nthe French at Blenheim--a day that made \"Malbrook\" a name of dread to\nevery French child, a name to frighten into good behaviour. To the\nlittle fellow's home came the horror-spoken talk of Ramilies; then of\nOudenarde; then of Lille--to his six-year-old ears the terrible news\nof Malplaquet.\n\nBut there was Paris a-bellringing in his ears at seven; for there was\nborn to the king's grandson a sickly child that was to succeed him as\nLouis the Fifteenth. And Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is one day to step from his\nmodest home and stand nearer at this child's side than he thinks.\n\nThe boy Boucher, at sturdy twelve, would recall the death of the old\nking in his lonely last years, and the setting upon the ancient throne\nof France of the five-year-old child as Louis Quinze--a comely little\nfellow--with Orleans as Regent. Young Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was to spend\nhis youth and grow up to manhood in a France that lay under the\nregency of this dissolute, brilliant Orleans.\n\nNicolas Boucher, the father, seems to have been an obscure, honest\nfellow, given to the trade of art, and that too in mediocre fashion\nenough, designing embroideries, covers for chairs, and the like--\"an\ninferior designer, little favoured by fortune,\" runs the recorded\nverdict of his day. But he had the virtue of recognising his\nmediocrity, and the desire to save his son from the sordid cares of\nmediocre artistry; since, having himself given the boy his schooling\nwith pencil and brush, and brought the lad up in an atmosphere of art\nand in the company of artists, he had the astuteness to send him to\nthe studio of Lemoyne, a really great painter and rapidly becoming\nfamous--he who painted the ceilings of Versailles with gods and\ngoddesses in handsome fashion.\n\nLemoyne was a well-chosen master for the promising youth of seventeen.\n\nHe had founded his art upon that of Correggio and Veronese, had rid\nhimself of hard academic tendencies, and was painting in a sound\nFrench fashion. The youth Boucher, with the quick and astounding gift,\nthat he displayed all through his life, of rapidly making his own what\nhe wanted to acquire, picked up from Lemoyne at once a French way of\nstating what he desired to state, in a large, broad manner, without\nhaving to go through the long years of drudgery to Italian models of\nstyle which was then the only schooling for an artist--was therefore\nenabled to free himself from the equally long years that it would have\ntaken him to rid the Italian style from his artistry. In short, the\nyouth of seventeen made Lemoyne's art his own in a few weeks; and, on\nthe eve of manhood, he so rivalled his master in accomplishment that\nit is dangerous to attribute a picture of this time to the master or\nthe pupil without most careful evidence.\n\nYet the youth vowed that he was but three months with Lemoyne, who,\nsaid he, took scant interest in his pupils. But it must be remembered\nthat Boucher was a prodigious worker, with a passionate love for his\nwork that lasted until death took the brush from his fingers, and that\nhe had a quick and alert mind and hand, free from the hesitances of a\nstudent, and always daring in experiment. To wish to achieve a thing,\nfor Boucher, was to set him to its achievement. He rested neither\nnight nor day until he mastered that which he had set out to do. On\nthe day he left Lemoyne's studio he stepped out of it a finished\nartist, a sound painter, fully equipped with all the craftmanship,\ntrade-secrets, and tricks of thumb that it had taken his master his\nlife to learn--and a facile copyist of his style and handling. It was\nthe sincerest form of flattery; and Boucher, to the end of his days,\nheld the art of Lemoyne in the greatest reverence--as is proved by his\nanswer, when at the very height of his fame, to one who asked him to\ncomplete a picture by his master: \"Such works are to me sacred\nvessels,\" said he--\"I should dread to profane them by touching them.\"\n\nLemoyne's admiration for his pupil was not lacking in return. The\nyouth painted, whilst with his master, a picture of a \"Judgment of\nSusanna,\" before which Lemoyne stood astounded, then burst into\nprophecy of Boucher achieving greatness in the years to come.\n\nFrom Lemoyne's studio, the young fellow went to live with \"P\u00e8re Cars,\"\nthe engraver, whose son, Laurent, was a friend of the youth, and who\nengaged him to design the drawings for his engravers, allowing him in\nreturn his food, lodging, and sixty livres (double-florins) a\nmonth--some twelve pounds. Boucher accounted his fortune made.\n\nThe cheery youth went at his work with energy and enthusiasm, blithely\nsetting his hand to anything that was wanted of him, bringing charm\nand invention to all he did--tailpieces, frontispieces, emblems, coats\nof arms, freemason's certificates, first-communion cards, initial\nletters. He was soon set to work upon important designs for\nengravings. He searched out the publishers of books, and let no\nchance escape of working for them.\n\nThus and otherwise he filled his scanty purse--that needed filling,\nfor he was quick at its emptying, being of a free hand and generous\ndisposition. And hard as he worked, so did he play. Work and pleasure\nwere his joy in life.\n\nAnd all the time he was taking part in the students' competitions for\nthe Academy.\n\nIt was in his nineteenth year that, in this same Paris, in the house\nof one of its rich families, was born a little girl-child who was to\ncome into Boucher's life in after years. The father, a financial\nfellow, one Poisson, was a man of shady repute; indeed he was under\nbanishment for mis-handling the public moneys at the time of the\nbirth of the little girl-child, christened Jeanne Antoinette\nPoisson--destined to be the Jane of the scurrilous street songs of the\nyears to come. But the careless student knew little of it as yet, nor\nthat destiny had put into the pretty child's cradle the sceptre and\ndiadem of France as plaything.\n\nBoucher, on the eve of manhood, took as little heed of the child's\ncoming as did the thirteen-year-old lad who sat upon the throne, and\nwho, in little Jane Poisson's first year, was declared to be of man's\nestate and ruler of France, no longer requiring Regent Orleans to\ngovern for him.\n\nIt was in this his nineteenth year that Boucher took the first prize\nat the Academy with his picture of \"Evilmerodach, son and successor of\nNebuchadnezzar, delivering Joachin from chains, in which his father\nhad for a long time held him.\"\n\nThis success set the collectors buying pictures by the brilliant\nyoungster. But Fran\u00e7ois Boucher needs no paying orders to make him\nwork--he paints for the love of the thing, declares that his \"studio\nis his church,\" and seeks to display his art and spread the repute of\nit abroad. And his fame grows apace, if at a cost. Nay, he courts fame\neven to the extent of hanging his pictures upon the tapestries and\ncarpets and such like draperies that the police oblige the citizens to\nhang out from their houses along the Place Dauphin and the Pont-Neuf\nduring the procession of the F\u00eate-Dieu--called the Exposition de la\nJeunesse.\n\nThere was a thing happened about this time that was to be of large\nsignificance to the young fellow's craftsmanship. Watteau had lately\ndied, his eager will burning out the poor stricken body. His friend De\nJulienne, anxious to publish a book to Watteau's memory, strolled into\nthe engraving-studio behind \"P\u00e8re Cars'\" shop, where Boucher and his\ncomrade, Laurent Cars, were wont to spend a part of their time; and he\ncommissioned Boucher to engrave 125 of the plates after the dead\nmaster. Watteau's essentially French influence was the impulse above\nall others to thrust forward the development of Boucher's genius along\nits right path, and sent his art towards its great goal. The business\nwas a rare delight to the young artist, and in the doing of it he\nlearnt many lessons which added greatly to the enhancement of his\nstyle; whilst the payment of twenty-four livres (double-florins) a day\nstill further increased his delight and contentment.\n\nHe completed the series with his wonted fiery zeal and rapid facility,\nand thus and otherwise, hotly pursuing his study of nature and his\nart, he arrived at the moment when his education should receive its\ninevitable finishing state in the Italian tour; so to Rome he went\nwith Carle Van Loo and his two nephews, Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Van Loo.\n\nOf Boucher's wander-years in Italy little is known. He seems to have\nshown scant respect for the accepted standards of the schools and the\ncritics, to have found Michael Angelo \"contorted,\" Raphael \"insipid,\"\nand Carrache \"gloomy.\" He, in fact, was drawn only to such artists as\nwere to his taste, and he had the courage to say so. However, whether\nhe were kept idle from ill-health or not; whether his stay were short\nor not, he appears again in Paris in three years--suspiciously like\nthe three years' conventional Italian study of a first-prize winner of\nthe Academy--with a large number of religious pictures to his\ncredit--pictures that were hailed by the Academicians and critics\nalike for their beauty, their force, and their virility--pictures\nwhich, perhaps fortunately for Boucher's repute, have vanished, or\nhang in galleries under other names.\n\nHere we see Boucher grimly putting aside his own taste and aims in\nart, and doggedly bending his will and hand to a prodigious effort to\nwin the reputation and standing of a \"serious painter,\" without which\nhe could not hope to attain academic honours. He won them; for, in\nthis his twenty-eighth year, on his return to Paris,",
                "-INFANT SCHOOLS AND DISSENTERS: A VINDICATION OF \u201cA LETTER OF AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE\u201d-\n\n\nCHAPTER: PREFACE.\n\n\nTHE following Vindication was written during the week in which the Rev.\nJohn Perowne\u2019s \u201cObservations\u201d appeared; and the publication of it has\nbeen hitherto delayed, partly from an unwillingness to pursue the subject\nof my \u201cLetter\u201d any farther, and partly from a determination not to\npublish till a fair opportunity had been given to obtain subscribers to\nthe New Infant School Society.  In replying to Mr. Geary it was\nimpossible to write with any other impression than that I was answering a\ngentleman and a Christian; and I hope that such an impression is\nmanifested in my pages.  And though Mr. Perowne has chosen to make my\n\u201cLetter\u201d on Infant Schools the pretext for a rude and personal attack, as\nwell as for insulting the whole body of Dissenters, I have nevertheless\nendeavoured to treat him with some degree of forbearance, and have in\nmany instances chastised him with whips only, when scorpions were at\nhand.  The great questions at issue between Churchmen and Dissenters\nnever can be settled by slander and abuse.  Mr. Perowne\u2019s pamphlet\ntherefore must be an utter failure; and I hope that all who have read it,\nor who may read this, will retire from them both, diligently and devoutly\nto study the New Testament, as the only standard of Christian faith, and\nof Ecclesiastical government.\n\nNorwich, June 6th, 1836.\n\n\nCHAPTER: A VINDICATION\n\n\nWHEN I had read the pamphlet, published by my esteemed friend Mr. Geary,\nin reply to my \u201cLetter,\u201d it appeared to me that the facts, relative to\nthe proposed Infant School Society, were sufficiently before the public;\nand, therefore, I determined to send him a few explanatory remarks in\nwriting, rather than to make any reply through the medium of the press.\n\nHaving been induced to alter my determination, I respectfully submit to\nMr. Geary\u2019s consideration, the following brief observations.\n\nBefore the examination of the Infant Schools took place in St. Andrew\u2019s\nHall, the public were informed, by the newspapers, that it had been\ndetermined on, at a meeting held in the Guildhall, to which none but\nmembers of the Establishment were invited.  William Moore, Esq. was in\nthe chair, and the following resolution was passed:\u2014\u201cResolved, that the\nsystem of Infant Education might be beneficially extended in this city;\nand, with a view of prominently bringing forward its advantages, that\nthere should be an examination of the children now receiving instruction\nin the Infant Schools of this city.\u201d  The meeting which adopted that\nresolution, appeared to me to originate and to authorize the examination\nof the schools\u2014and, whatever private understanding there might be with\nMr. Wilderspin, all that the public knew was what the resolution stated;\nand Mr. Wilderspin appeared to us, not as accomplishing \u201chis own\nspeculation,\u201d but as the agent, employed by the meeting, to carry its\nresolution into effect.  I think, therefore, that what I have stated, in\nthe eighth and ninth pages of my \u201cLetter,\u201d is fully borne out by all the\nfacts of the case.\n\nI said nothing in my \u201cLetter\u201d to intimate that the children of Dissenters\nwould be excluded from the proposed schools.  My explanation of the\n\u201cAdvertisement\u201d which occasioned the \u201cLetter\u201d was this: \u201cI understand it\nto mean, that the members of no other Christian church shall be allowed\nto participate with you in the formation of the society, or in its\ncommittee, or in its operations.\u201d  If, however, I had expressed a fear\nthat the church catechism might be introduced, or that some arrangement\nmight be made which would prevent Dissenters from sending their children\nto the schools, the speeches at the public meeting, and Mr. Geary\u2019s\npamphlet, satisfactorily negative such an apprehension.  All parties have\nunited in declaring that the schools will be open to all classes, and\nthat there will be no rules nor formulas against which Dissenters can\nobject.  At the public meeting, as reported in the newspapers, the Dean\nexpressly stated, that \u201cthey had no desire to exclude the children of any\npersons of whatever religion, because the children would not be\ninstructed in any points that any person might not learn; as they would\nbe taught to worship and adore God, to know the merits of our Saviour, to\nfear God and honour the King, and to live in peace and unity with one\nanother.  Their rules, said he, would be open to persons of all\ndenominations, who would have the opportunity of sending their children,\nif they accorded with those rules.\u201d  Mr. G. Seppings \u201cstated that the\nschool would be open to the children of persons of all denominations,\nwho might choose to send them.\u201d  In full accordance with these decisive\nstatements, Mr. Geary says, \u201cI cannot help again recurring to a mistake\ninto which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout\nimplied, in regard to the exclusion of the children of dissent.  He may\nrest assured, that nothing is decided with respect to the discipline of\nthe schools, which can possibly be held to be an impediment with any\nconscientious Dissenter who desires to place his child there:\u2014no impeding\ntests or testimonials on entering the school\u2014no offensive rituals when\nthere.\u201d  And in another part of his pamphlet he declares, \u201cI have seen\nthe progress of the society in embryo, first, last, midst, and throughout\nall, without witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.  Should it appear,\nI am prepared to contend with it hand to hand\u2014foot to foot; and, should\nit unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the society.\u201d  The\nspeeches at the public meeting are, however, a sufficient guarantee that\nno such spirit will \u201cunhappily prevail;\u201d and I \u201crest assured,\u201d that, so\nfar as the schools are concerned, they will be as comprehensive as those\nwhich already exist, and to which the children of Churchmen and\nDissenters are admitted on equal terms.  I deeply regret, however, that\nmy interpretation of the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d has unfortunately proved true,\nand that, though the children of Dissenters are to be admitted into the\nschools, Dissenters themselves are, quite unnecessarily I think, excluded\nfrom the committee of the society, and from all its operations.\n\nThe public meeting, at which the preceding speeches were delivered, was\ndistinguished by the expression of many liberal and Christian sentiments;\nand those of us who were excluded from it, were in no small degree\ngratified in learning, from the public papers, that several of the\nspeakers expressed themselves so decidedly in favour of the liberal\nsystem advocated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d and that they regretted that\ncircumstances constrained them to unite with the present exclusive\nsystem.  \u201cMr. Bignold said he had not been in favour of any exclusive\nviews; and if it had been thought right to establish a general society,\nhe should have with pleasure supported it.  That had not been agreed to,\nbut if the Dissenters chose to establish another society, his funds\nshould be at their service.\u201d  \u201cThe Rev. R. Hankinson spoke in favour of\nan open society.  He said he belonged to several in the city, all of\nwhich were carried on with the greatest unanimity.  He had, however,\nyielded his opinions to those of others better qualified, perhaps, to\njudge.\u201d  I need not add that these are also the sentiments of Mr. Geary,\nwho says, in reference to my wishes for an union of all parties, \u201cI truly\nsympathize with him in those views and feelings which, were it\npracticable, would suggest such an union;\u201d and, \u201cmy reverend friend\ncannot feel more intense satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the\njoyful and happy state of brethren dwelling together in unity.\u201d\n\nI most earnestly hope and pray that these sentiments, so honourable to\nthe gentlemen who uttered them, may more extensively prevail, till they\nhave removed those \u201cinsuperable barriers\u201d which at present exist, and\ntill they have rendered that union \u201cpracticable,\u201d which so many feel to\nbe desirable.  Depend upon it, there are not half the difficulties really\nexisting, which some persons imagine.  The united system, if tried,\nwould, I am persuaded, work well\u2014and I am sure that all who engaged in it\nwould be made better and happier by their combined exertions in doing\ngood.  There are some things, connected with both Church of Englandism\nand Dissent, in which the two parties could not unite without a\ncompromise of principle.  As religious men, we have, however, a common\ncause to promote, and a common enemy to withstand.  We ought, therefore,\nas Christians, to unite in every thing that admits of an union; and, as\nInfant Schools appear to me to be precisely of that character, I deeply\nregret that we have not united in them.  I am somewhat comforted,\nhowever, by the persuasion, that an exclusive system cannot last.  There\nis an influential and increasing party in the church much opposed to it,\nand who, as is stated in my \u201cLetter,\u201d \u201cwould be glad to co-operate with\nother Christians in educating and in evangelizing the people.\u201d  The\nadoption of the exclusive system has occasioned regret in the minds of\nmany persons whom the church would have done well to conciliate; and I\nmuch question whether either party is perfectly satisfied with the\nproceedings that have been adopted.\n\nAnother remark or two will bring this part of my pamphlet to a close.\n\nMr. Geary is mistaken in supposing that I mentioned Leicester and Taunton\nas towns \u201cwhere a satisfactory union had been effected.\u201d  My extracts\nrespecting them were intended to shew Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s opinion respecting\nthe union of various denominations in the work.  I said nothing\nrespecting any schools at Leicester; and I quoted Mr. Babington\u2019s speech\nfor the sake of shewing, not only his sentiments, but Mr. Wilderspin\u2019s\nalso, because he calls it \u201can admirable speech.\u201d  And as to Taunton,\nafter quoting what Mr. Wilderspin had said in approbation of the mixed\ncommittee, I distinctly stated that \u201ca school was set up on opposite\nprinciples.\u201d\n\nHaving stated in my \u201cLetter\u201d that the extracts which I had made from Mr.\nWilderspin\u2019s book abundantly proved that he was \u201cdecidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich,\u201d Mr. Geary replies that this\nappeal to the authority of Mr. Wilderspin \u201crequires qualifying;\u201d and\n\u201cthat the cases do not lead to this conclusion.\u201d  If Mr. Geary will be so\ngood as to turn again to my quotations, I think he will be induced to\nagree with me that Mr. Wilderspin could scarcely have used stronger\nlanguage than he has used in reference to this subject.  He most\nenthusiastically admires Joseph Lancaster\u2019s system, because of \u201cits\nbenevolent and Catholic spirit,\u201d which establishes \u201cschools for all;\u201d and\nhe solemnly declares that he always has laboured on \u201cthe broadest\nprinciple,\u201d and that he determines to act \u201con that, and on that alone,\nthrough the remainder of his life.\u201d  I think, therefore, I am authorized\nin repeating my former declaration, that \u201che is decidedly opposed to the\nexclusive system advertised for Norwich.\u201d\n\nThese cursory remarks are intended to rectify some mistakes into which\nMr. Geary appears to me to have fallen in his perusal of my \u201cLetter.\u201d\n\nAfter all, I rejoice to believe that he and I are one in sentiment and\nfeeling on this subject.  The gentlemanly and Christian tone of his\nletter, is an interesting evidence that there may be discussion and\ncontroversy without violating any of the principles of the gospel, or any\nof the courtesies of life.  I thank him, for his testimony that my\n\u201cLetter\u201d \u201cis characterised by a spirit of mildness and conciliation,\u201d and\nI am glad to find that he has read it in the spirit in which it was\nwritten.  I thank him also for the manner in which he has spoken of the\n\u201ccourtesy\u201d manifested by the Dissenters connected with the Infant Schools\nin this city towards their brethren in the Establishment.  And I take\nleave of him in the hope, and with the prayer that, though we cannot walk\ntogether through every path on earth, we may, through \u201cthe precious blood\nof Christ,\u201d and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, both of us be\nfound in that heaven of light and love, where we shall no longer \u201csee\nthrough a glass darkly, but face to face, and where we shall know even as\nalso we are known.\u201d\n\nI come now to the consideration of a subject on which I enter with\nreluctance.  Since Mr. Geary\u2019s pamphlet appeared, \u201cObservations\u201d on my\n\u201cLetter\u201d have been published by a person who styles himself, \u201cThe Rev. J.\n\nPerowne, Rector of St. John\u2019s Maddermarket, Norwich.\u201d  With some of the\nmembers of his family, I have, for a long time, been acquainted.  They\nhave belonged to my congregation for nearly twenty years; and one of them\nhas lately become a member of the church of",
                "-THE WAR OF THE WENUSES-\n\n\nBOOK I. - The Coming of the Wenuses.\n\n\nCHAPTER: I. - \"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER.\"\n\n\nNo one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century\nthat men and modistes on this planet were being watched by intelligences\ngreater than woman's and yet as ambitious as her own. With infinite\ncomplacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene in the\nassurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus\ndoes the same. Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of\ndanger, or thought of it only to dismiss the idea of active rivalry upon\nit as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space astral\nwomen, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are\nto boot-buttons, astral women, with hearts vast and warm and\nsympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy, Peter Robinson's with\njealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely\nmaturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.\n\nThe pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader,\nrevolves round the sun at a mean distance of \nvermillion miles. More than that, as has been proved by the recent\nobservations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely\nadvancing sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for\nclothes to be worn at all; and this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a\nprospect that the immediate problem of life became the discovery of new\nquarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The\nlast stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had\nembellished their charms, heightened their heels and enlarged their\nhearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted exclusively of\nInvisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however,\nnot judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species\nhas wrought, not only on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon\nits own inferior races such as the Wanishing Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.\n\nThe Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine\naccuracy. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed\ntheir preparations. Similarly pigs, had they wings, might fly. Men like\nQuellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the way,\nthat for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by\nevening growing alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but\nfailed to interpret the extraordinary phenomena, resembling a series of\npowder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac penumbra on the\nnight of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by\nIdos of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.\n\nThe storm burst upon us six weeks later, about the time of the summer\nsales. As Wenus approached opposition, Dr. Jelli of Guava set the wires\nof the astronomical exchange palpitating with the intelligence of a huge\nexplosion of laughing gas moving risibly towards the earth. He compared\nit to a colossal cosmic cachinnation. And, in the light of subsequent\nevents, the justice of the comparison will commend itself to all but the\nmost sober readers.\n\nHad it not been for my chance meeting with Swears, the eminent\nastronomer and objurgationist, this book would never have been written.\n\nHe asked me down to our basement, which he rents from me as an\nobservatory, and in spite of all that has happened since I still\nremember our wigil very distinctly. (I spell it with a \"w\" from an\ninordinate affection for that letter.) Swears moved about, invisible but\npainfully audible to my naked ear. The night was very warm, and I was\nvery thirsty. As I gazed through the syphon, the little star seemed\nalternately to expand and contract, and finally to assume a sort of dual\nskirt, but that was simply because my eye was tired. I remember how I\nsat under the table with patches of green and crimson swimming before my\neyes. Grotesque and foolish as this may seem to the sober reader, it is\nabsolutely true.\n\nSwears watched till one, and then he gave it up. He was full of\nspeculations about the condition of Wenus. Swears' language was\nextremely sultry.\n\n\"The chances against anything lady-like on Wenus,\" he said, \"are a\nmillion to one.\"\n\nEven Pearson's Weekly woke up to the disturbance at last, and Mrs.\nLynn Linton contributed an article entitled \"What Women Might Do\" to the\nQueen. A paper called Punch, if I remember the name aright, made a\npun on the subject, which was partially intelligible with the aid of\nitalics and the laryngoscope. For my own part, I was too much occupied\nin teaching my wife to ride a Bantam, and too busy upon a series of\npapers in Nature on the turpitude of the classical professoriate of\nthe University of London, to give my undivided attention to the\nimpending disaster. I cannot divide things easily; I am an indivisible\nman. But one night I went for a bicycle ride with my wife. She was a\nBantam of delight, I can tell you, but she rode very badly. It was\nstarlight, and I was attempting to explain the joke in the paper called,\nif I recollect aright, Punch. It was an extraordinarily sultry night,\nand I told her the names of all the stars she saw as she fell off her\nmachine. She had a good bulk of falls. There were lights in the upper\nwindows of the houses as the people went to bed. Grotesque and foolish\nas this will seem to the sober reader, it is absolutely true. Coming\nhome, a party of bean-feasters from Wimbledon, Wormwood Scrubs, or\nWoking passed us, singing and playing concertinas. It all seemed so safe\nand tranquil. But the Wenuses were even then on their milky way.\n\n\nCHAPTER: II. - THE FALLING STAR.\n\n\nThen came the night of the first star. It was seen early in the morning\nrushing over Winchester; leaving a gentle frou-frou behind it. Trelawny,\nof the Wells' Observatory, the greatest authority on Meteoric\nCrinolines, watched it anxiously. Winymann, the publisher, who sprang to\nfame by the publication of The War of the Worlds, saw it from his\noffice window, and at once telegraphed to me: \"Materials for new book in\nthe air.\" That was the first hint I received of the wonderful wisit.\n\nI lived in those days at 181a Campden Hill Gardens. It is the house\nopposite the third lamp-post on the right as you walk east. It was of\nbrick and slate, with a party-wall, and two spikes were wanting to the\niron railings. When the telegram came I was sitting in my study writing\na discussion on the atomic theory of Krelli of Balmoral. I at once\nchanged the Woking jacket in which I was writing for evening\ndress--which wanted, I remember, a button--and hastened to the Park. I\ndid not tell my wife anything about it. I did not care to have her with\nme. In all such adventures I find her more useful as a sentimental\nfigure in the background--I, of course, allow no sentiment in the\nforeground--than an active participant.\n\nOn the way I met Swears, returning from breakfast with our mutual\nfriend, Professor Heat Ray Lankester--they had had Lee-Metford sardines\nand Cairns marmalade, he told me,--and we sought the meteor together.\n\nFind it we did in Kensington Gardens. An enormous dimple had been made\nby the impact of the projectile, which lay almost buried in the earth.\n\nTwo or three trees, broken by its fall, sprawled on the turf. Among this\nd\u00e9bris was the missile; resembling nothing so much as a huge\ncrinoline. At the moment we reached the spot P.C. A581 was ordering it\noff; and Henry Pearson, aged 28 (no fixed abode), and Martha Griffin,\naged 54, of Maybury Tenements, were circulating among the crowd offering\nmatches for sale. They have nothing to do with this story, but their\nnames and addresses make for verisimilitude; or at least, I hope so. In\ncase they do not, let me add that Mary Griffin wore a blue peignoir\nwhich had seen better days, and Herbert Pearson's matches struck\neverywhere except on the box.\n\nWith a mental flash we linked the Crinoline with the powder puffs on\nWenus. Approaching it more nearly, we heard a hissing noise within, such\nas is made by an ostler, or Mr. Daimler grooming his motor car.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Swears, \"there's a horse in it. Can't you hear? He\nmust be half-roasted.\"\n\nSo saying he rushed off, fraught with pity, to inform the Secretary of\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; while I hurried\naway to tell Pendriver the journalist, proposing in my own mind, I\nrecollect, that he should give me half the profits on the article.\n\nPendriver the journalist, so called to distinguish him from Hoopdriver\nthe cyclist, was working in his garden. He does the horticultural column\nfor one of the large dailies.\n\n\"You've read about the disturbances in Venus?\" I cried.\n\n\"What!\" said Pendriver. He is as deaf as the Post, the paper he writes\nfor.\n\n\"You've read about Venus?\" I asked again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I've never been to Venice.\"\n\n\"Venus!\" I bawled, \"Venus!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pendriver, \"Venus. What about it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" I said, \"there are people from Venus in Kensington Gardens.\"\n\n\"Venus in Kensington Gardens!\" he replied. \"No, it's not Venus; it's the\nQueen.\"\n\nI began to get angry.\n\n\"Not the statue,\" I shouted. \"Wisitors from Wenus. Make copy. Come and\nsee! Copy! Copy!\"\n\nThe word \"copy\" galvanised him, and he came, spade and all. We quickly\ncrossed the Park once more. Pendriver lives to the west of it, in\nStrathmore Gardens, and has a special permit from his landlord to dig.\n\nWe did not, for sufficient reasons, converse much. Many persons were now\nhastening towards the strange object. Among them I noticed Jubal Gregg\nthe butcher (who fortunately did not observe me--we owed him a trifle of\neighteen shillings, and had since taken to Canterbury lamb from the\nColonial Meat Stores), and a jobbing gardener, whom I had not recently\npaid. I forget his name, but he was lame in the left leg: a ruddy man.\n\nQuite a crowd surrounded the Crinoline when we arrived, and in addition\nto the match-vendors already mentioned, there was now Giuseppe\nMandolini, from Leather Lane, with an accordion and a monkey. Monkeys\nare of course forbidden in Kensington Gardens, and how he eluded the\npolice I cannot imagine. Most of the people were staring quietly at the\nCrinoline, totally unaware of its significance. Scientific knowledge has\nnot progressed at Kensington by the same leaps and bounds as at Woking.\n\nExtra-terrestrial had less meaning for them than extra-special.\n\nWe found Swears hard at work keeping the crowd from touching the\nCrinoline. With him was a tall, red-haired man, who I afterwards learnt\nwas Lee-Bigge, the Secretary of the Society for the Prevention of\nCruelty to Animals. He had a summons and several officials with him, and\nwas standing on the Crinoline, bellowing directions in a clear, rich\nvoice, occasionally impeded by emotion, like an ox with a hiccough.\n\nAs soon as Swears saw me, he asked me to bring a policeman to assist him\nto keep back the crowd; and I went away, proud to be so honoured, to\nfind one. I was unsuccessful. P.C. A581 had gone off duty; but another\nconstable, I was told, had been seen, an hour or so earlier, asleep\nagainst the railings,--it was a baker's boy who told me, just back from\ndelivering muffins in St. Mary Abbot's Terrace,--and had since wandered\nin the direction of the Albert Hall. I followed, but could not see him\nin any of the areas, and therefore returned slowly by way of Queen's\nGate, Cromwell Road, Earl's Court Road, and Kensington High Street,\nhoping to meet another; and as it was then about noon, I entered an\nA.B.C. and had half a pork-pie and a bucket of Dr. Jaeger's Vi-cocolate.\n\nI remember the circumstance distinctly, because feeling rather hungry\nand wishing to vary the menu, I asked the girl for half a veal-and-ham\npie and she brought me the balance of the original pasty; and when I\nremonstrated, she said that her directors recognised no essential\ndifference between veal-and-ham and pork.\n\n\nCHAPTER: III. - THE CRINOLINE EXPANDS.\n\n\nWhen I returned to the Gardens the sun was at his zenith. The crowd\naround the Crinoline had increased and some sort of a struggle seemed to\nbe going on. As I drew near I heard Lee-Bigge's voice:\n\"Keep back! keep back!\"\n\nA boy came running towards me.\n\n\"It's a-movin',\" he said to me as he passed; \"a-blowin' and a-blowin'\n\nout. Now we shan't be long!\" Passing on, I saw that it was indeed\nexpanding. The ribs were more distended and the covering more tightly\nstretched. The hissing had ceased and a creaking noise had taken its\nplace. There was evidently great pressure within. Once something\nresembling an en tout cas was thrust"
